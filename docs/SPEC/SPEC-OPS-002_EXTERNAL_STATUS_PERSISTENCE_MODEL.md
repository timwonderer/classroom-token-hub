# SPEC-OPS-002: External Status Persistence Model

| Reference Number | Version | Effective Date | Supersedes | Authority Level |
|------------------|---------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| SPEC-OPS-002 | 1.4 | 2026-09-19 | 1.3 | Normative |

## I. Purpose

Define the minimum logical persistence model for independent external status infrastructure. This specification stops at object semantics and does not authorize provisioning, indexes, retention schedules, or runtime implementation.

## II. Scope

This model governs externally observed service conditions, independently publishable status notices, public projections, bounded history, and optional reconciliation references. It does not persist, reproduce, or replace canonical Operations incidents or any CTH business-domain state.

## III. Authority Level

Normative (SPEC Tier). Subordinate to `INV-CORE-000`, `INV-CORE-001`, `INV-ARC-009`, `INV-ARC-016`, `DOM-OPS-001`, `DOM-OPS-002`, and `SOP-OPS-001`.

## IV. Dependencies

- `DOM-OPS-001_OPERATIONS_DOMAIN.md`
- `DOM-OPS-002_AUDIT_LINEAGE_INTEGRITY.md`
- `SOP-OPS-001_SERVICE_STATUS_AND_INCIDENT_COMMUNICATION.md`

## V. Persistence Objects

### 5.1 External Observation — append-only

Records one bounded observation received by the independent status service for
one public capability or infrastructure dependency. The condition may be
measured by the external collector itself or evaluated within CTH and
transported to the collector. Persistence outside CTH does not make an
application-produced result an independently performed external probe.

Required logical fields:

- stable observation ID;
- check time (`checked_at`, null only when no check ran), collector receipt
  time (`received_at`), and correlation ID;
- approved freshness class and immutable staleness state at receipt;
- bounded evidence source, including independent `EXTERNAL_PROBE` and
  `APPLICATION_RUNTIME_EVIDENCE` for feature results transported from CTH;
- capability/component key from a closed registry;
- observation class: `LIVENESS`, `READINESS`, `CORRECTNESS`, or `INFRASTRUCTURE_FAILURE`;
- outcome: `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `UNKNOWN`;
- epistemic state: `KNOWN` or `UNAVAILABLE`;
- bounded diagnostic code and bounded latency/result metadata;
- probe version, identifying the external collector/check transport;
- bounded evaluator version for a registered application feature result;
  null only when no feature evaluator ran (including an unregistered
  `UNKNOWN` result) or for non-feature observations.

The current projection recomputes staleness from `checked_at`, freshness
class, and evaluation time. An old recorded `FRESH` state cannot keep a
capability green after its maximum age. A missing check time cannot establish
current health. For an external probe, check time is the time of its own
measurement; for an application result, the collector preserves CTH's
original check time rather than replacing it with receipt time.

Observations MUST NOT contain tenant identifiers, PII, credentials, raw response bodies, stack traces, arbitrary payloads, or inferred internal causes. They cannot be updated or deleted during their retention window. `CONFLICTING` is not a raw-observation state; it belongs to derived assessment or projection state composed from multiple observations.

An external collector MUST preserve the source of the condition it transports:
fetching an application-produced feature result does not turn that result
into an independent external probe. Its own reachability measurement remains
an `EXTERNAL_PROBE`, separately timestamped from the application's bounded
feature assessment. Both records retain their original provenance. The
collector protocol's `probe_version` is not evidence of which owning feature
evaluator ran; a conclusive registered feature result also requires its
separate `evaluator_version` from CTH.

The fields have distinct meanings: `outcome` records the result of this observation; `epistemic_state` records whether the capability state can be established from the available evidence. A single observation cannot claim aggregate disagreement.

#### Observation State Matrix

| Outcome | Epistemic state | Validity | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PASS` | `KNOWN` | Valid | The probe established the tested condition successfully. |
| `FAIL` | `KNOWN` | Valid | The probe established that the tested condition failed. |
| `FAIL` | `UNAVAILABLE` | Valid | The probe could not reach or obtain a usable result from the target; the target is not thereby proven internally faulty. |
| `UNKNOWN` | `UNAVAILABLE` | Valid | No usable result was obtained and no pass/fail conclusion is lawful. |
| `PASS` | `UNAVAILABLE` | **Invalid** | A successful result cannot simultaneously be unavailable. |
| `UNKNOWN` | `KNOWN` | **Invalid** | An unknown outcome cannot assert that the condition is known. |

The Cartesian product of the declared raw-observation enums consists of six possible combinations. Only the four combinations explicitly marked valid are lawful; the remaining two are invalid and MUST be rejected before persistence. `CONFLICTING` is excluded from the raw-observation enum and may appear only on a derived assessment or public projection.

The public capability state is derived from the set of observations and applicable canonical publication information. A `PASS + KNOWN` observation may support a public `AVAILABLE` state only when no newer valid failure or unresolved disagreement controls the projection. A `FAIL + KNOWN`, `FAIL + UNAVAILABLE`, or derived `CONFLICTING` state MUST NOT be projected as healthy. Missing observations do not imply `PASS`.

### 5.2 External Status Notice — append-only publication history

Records a bounded communication artifact published independently when canonical Operations publication is unavailable or when an explicitly authorized external communication is required.

Required logical fields:

- stable external notice ID;
- append-only notice event ID, event type, and publication timestamp;
- notice state: `INVESTIGATING`, `IDENTIFIED`, `MONITORING`, or `RESOLVED`;
- affected capability key;
- impact statement;
- recommended user action, including `NO_ACTION_REQUIRED` where applicable;
- recovery expectation state: `KNOWN`, `ESTIMATED`, or `UNAVAILABLE`;
- recovery expectation only when supported by the state;
- next-update timestamp or explicit `NEXT_UPDATE_UNAVAILABLE` state;
- source observation IDs and bounded author/provenance metadata;
- optional reconciliation reference.

The notice is not a canonical incident. Its existence MUST NOT imply that a canonical incident exists.

### 5.3 Public Status Projection — replaceable derived state

Contains the current public view derived from retained observations and notice publication events. It MAY be replaced or rebuilt. It MUST identify whether the current view is based on external observation, canonical publication, or an unresolved disagreement, and MUST NOT be treated as authoritative incident state.

### 5.4 Historical Rollup — optional derived state

Aggregates system-level, non-tenant observations for availability and status-history presentation only. It is optional and must not be introduced until a concrete product need is identified. Rollups are replaceable derivatives, never source evidence.

## VI. Reconciliation

Reconciliation is optional linkage, not conversion. Store only:

- the stable external notice ID;
- the canonical incident identifier, when one exists;
- linkage timestamp and reconciliation outcome.

Do not copy canonical incident content into external storage. Do not require linkage for publication. Never rewrite the original observation, notice event, or public message after reconciliation.

## VII. Authority and Availability Rules

- Firestore MUST NOT contain `canonical_incidents`, authoritative `incident_events`, or authoritative `incident_summary`.
- External notices MAY be published while canonical incident publication is unavailable.
- When canonical publication is available, ordinary canonical incidents MUST NOT be duplicated automatically as external notices.
- Conflicting external observations produce an explicit `CONFLICTING` state; nulls and free-form strings MUST NOT encode epistemic meaning.
- No layer may infer internal cause or canonical domain state from external reachability alone.

## VIII. Retention Classes

The implementation must define separate retention classes before provisioning:

- detailed external observations and publication events: bounded operational evidence;
- public status projections: replaceable current state;
- historical rollups: longer-lived derived history only if justified;
- reconciliation links: retained long enough to preserve lineage, subject to Operations policy.

Generic cleanup MUST NOT cross retention classes or delete append-only evidence before its authorized retention boundary.

## IX. Deferred Implementation Decisions

This specification intentionally does not decide collection names, document paths, indexes, TTL values, probe cadence, Scheduler, Cloud Run, Firestore regions, deployment topology, authentication mechanisms, or public UI structure. Those decisions require review against this model.

## X. Amendment

Revisions require incrementing the version, updating the Effective Date and Supersedes fields, preserving the distinction between canonical Operations truth and external communication artifacts, and updating the documentation index.
