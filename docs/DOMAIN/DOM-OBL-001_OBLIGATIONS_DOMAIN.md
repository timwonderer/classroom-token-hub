## I. Purpose

This document defines the Obligations domain as the canonical authority over instantiated monetary liabilities, recurring rent cycles, and their lawful resolution.

Obligations owns:

- the existence of a liability after it has been lawfully assessed;
- the lifecycle of that liability through payment, waiver, or teacher-directed termination;
- recurring bill-cycle state for liabilities that must be reconsidered at a later boundary;
- the current rent cycle that is in force for the class.

Obligations does not own:

- the teacher-defined policy terms that create the liability;
- the Ledger movement that records money;
- the entitlement lifecycle or perk lifecycle itself;
- post hoc monetary correction after a ledger action;
- any mutable status flag that duplicates what can be derived from immutable facts.

---

## II. Scope

This domain governs:

- obligation event facts;
- recurring bill-cycle progression;
- derived obligation projections such as satisfied, outstanding, visible, and past due.

Obligations operates on class-scoped and seat-scoped truth. It never owns global money, global identity, or cross-class authority.

### A. Rent

Rent is a homegrown obligation lifecycle owned by Obligations. It is configured upstream by Class Configuration and Policies, but Obligations owns the assessment and recurring debt progression once the lawful rent contract exists.

### B. Insurance

Insurance is not owned by Obligations as a product lifecycle. Store and Entitlements owns the insurance entitlement / coverage lifecycle, and Policies owns the insurance definition. Obligations may service recurring insurance premiums as debt lifecycle, but only with lawful inputs supplied by the owning authority.

### C. Immediate Charges

Overdraft fees, NSF fees, and other immediately collected charges are still obligations when the system lawfully instantiates a liability before or alongside settlement. The fact that the liability is settled immediately does not remove it from this domain.

### D. Exclusions

Obligations does not own store purchases. Store purchases are immediate exchanges, not assessed liabilities.

## III. Authority Level

Tier 1 - Constitutional. This document defines structural enforcement mechanisms and domain-specific constraints that operationalize Foundational invariants.

It is subordinate to:

- `INV-CORE-000_CORE_INVARIANTS.md`
- `INV-CORE-001_CAPABILITY_BASED_ARCHITECTURE_AND_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md`
- `INV-ARC-009_DOMAIN_AUTHORITY_FOR_STATE.md`
- `INV-ARC-015_TEMPORAL_MODEL_AND_BOUNDARY_ENFORCEMENT.md`
- `INV-ARC-016_LAWFUL_EXISTENCE_AND_AUDIT_LINEAGE.md`
- `INV-ARC-021_CROSS_DOMAIN_REFERENCE_AND_COORDINATION.md`
- `DOM-CORE-000_DOMAIN_FOUNDATION.md`
- `DOM-CORE-002_CANONICAL_SCHEMA_DEFINITION.md`

---

## IV. Canonical Business Authority

The Obligations domain is the sole business authority responsible for:

- lawful assessment of monetary liabilities;
- lawful satisfaction of assessed liabilities through payment, waiver, or teacher-directed termination;
- recurring bill-cycle progression;
- the current rent cycle that is currently in force;
- derived status over obligation facts;
- cross-domain lineage preserved by internal reference, correlation, and bill-cycle identity.

Consumers SHALL NOT:

- derive obligation status independently;
- derive payment completeness independently;
- mutate obligation persistence directly;
- reinterpret the meaning of an obligation using label-based or route-local logic;
- write mutable status columns that duplicate derived truth.

Consumers SHALL instead invoke the canonical business operations owned by this domain.

## V. Vocabulary

### 1. Obligation

An obligation is an instantiated monetary liability associated with a seat.

An obligation exists because a lawful upstream authority determined that a seat owes money under a specific relationship or enforcement action.

The obligation does not own the monetary amount itself. The authoritative amount comes from the upstream contract/configuration or from the lawful caller supplying the assessed terms.

### 2. Internal Reference

An internal reference identifies a continuing obligation-producing relationship.

It answers:

> Which continuing relationship are these assessments part of?

The internal reference is stable across recurring assessments for the same continuing relationship.

It does not encode the business meaning of that relationship inside Obligations.

### 3. Correlation ID

A correlation ID identifies one individual instantiated obligation.

It binds together the immutable events that belong to that single liability instance.

### 4. Assessment

An assessment is the immutable fact that a liability lawfully came into existence.

Every liability begins with exactly one assessment.

### 5. Payment

A payment is the immutable fact that Ledger-backed monetary movement was applied toward an assessment.

Multiple payments may exist for the same assessment.

### 6. Waiver

A waiver is the immutable fact that the remaining outstanding rent liability no longer requires payment.

Waiver is rent-only.

Waiver creates no Ledger movement.

A waiver MAY carry a teacher-entered note explaining the reason. The note is optional, informational, and immutable after insert. It is not authoritative business truth — derived satisfaction rules (§VIII) do not consult it. It is stored solely so teachers and the affected student can later see why the waiver was granted. See §VII.1 `notes`.

### 7. Bill Cycle

A bill cycle is a recurring temporal instruction that says which policy UUID is current for a continuing obligation-producing relationship and when that cycle must be assessed again. It serves any recurring obligation lineage (rent per class, and insurance premiums per seat), distinguished by `internal_ref` and `obligation_type`.

Bill cycle does not know the teacher's intent beyond the persisted policy UUID and the next assessment boundary.

Bill cycle may carry the exact `policy_uuid` that it invokes.

The bill-cycle lifecycle has three distinct transitions, each an explicit command:

- **Genesis** (`nothing → cycle 1`): `establish_bill_cycle` establishes the first cycle where none exists for the lineage. `cycle_number = 1` is intrinsic, never caller-selected. A second genesis for the same lineage is unlawful — idempotency protects retries of a command, it does not license a second cycle 1.
- **Advancement** (`cycle N → cycle N+1`): FEAT-OBL-002 creates the strict successor from an existing current cycle; the successor number is derived from authoritative state. Advancement requires a prior cycle and never creates cycle 1.
- **Termination**: a terminal cycle row with `next_assessment_at = NULL` (see §VII.2) stops future recurrence; the lawful cancellation/termination authority performs it. It does not rewrite prior obligation events (§IX.7).

---

## VI. Schema Authority Declaration

This domain is the sole schema and mutation authority over:

- `assessment_events`
- `bill_cycles`

`DOM-CORE-002_CANONICAL_SCHEMA_DEFINITION.md` is authoritative for the exact target table set. This document defines the obligations-side meaning of those tables.

This domain does **not** own:

- any mutable paid/overdue/reversed scalar state
- insurance entitlement state
- Ledger transactions

---

## VII. Canonical Persistence

### 1. `assessment_events`

Records the historical fact of obligation events.

Key fields:

- `id`
- `timestamp` - time when the row is created, which represents the time when the assessment took place.
- `seat_id` - FK to `seats`
- `class_id` - FK to `classes`
- `internal_ref` - stable lineage key for the continuing obligation-producing relationship
- `correlation_id` - identifier for this individual liability instance
- `event_type` - `ASSESSMENT` | `PAYMENT` | `WAIVED`
- `obligation_type` - closed enum of lawful assessment categories
- `policy_uuid` - lawful source policy locator
- `bill_cycle_id` - nullable FK to `bill_cycles`
- `ledger_transaction_id` - nullable FK to `ledger_transaction`; required for `PAYMENT`
- `notes` - optional free-text metadata (see below)

Rules:

- exactly one `ASSESSMENT` exists per individual liability instance;
- `PAYMENT` may occur multiple times for the same assessment;
- `WAIVED` is rent-only;
- no amount is persisted here;
- no paid/unpaid/overdue/satisfied/reversed flag is persisted here;
- an assessment is immutable once lawfully written.

Notes column contract:

- `notes` is optional free-text metadata attached to any event row (`ASSESSMENT`, `PAYMENT`, or `WAIVED`).
- `notes` is set at insert time by the FEAT that writes the event, from an actor-supplied string (typically a teacher's reason for a waiver, an admin's justification for a manual adjustment, etc.).
- `notes` is immutable after insert, consistent with the general event immutability rule above.
- `notes` is NOT authoritative business truth. No derived satisfaction rule (§VIII), no cross-domain contract, and no operational legality check MAY read `notes` to decide behavior. Its purpose is human-audit visibility only.
- `notes` is visible to any actor who can see the underlying event (i.e., the teacher who administers the class, and the affected student for events on their own seat).
- Callers that omit `notes` (or pass empty string) SHALL result in `NULL`. Empty and NULL are equivalent in semantics.

### 2. `bill_cycles`

Records recurring temporal progression for any continuing obligation-producing relationship (rent per class; insurance premiums per seat), distinguished by `internal_ref` and the driven assessments' `obligation_type`.

Key fields:

- `id`
- `internal_ref` - for specific assessment_event referencing and advancement
- `cycle_number` - for advancement tracking
- `policy_uuid` - current rent policy locator
- `cycle_boundary_at` - due boundary for invoking assessment
- `next_assessment_at` - next lawful boundary for the continuing rent cycle

Rules:

- bill cycles do not store class identity or seat identity;
- bill cycles do not store amount;
- bill cycles do not store business meaning for the reference;
- bill cycles are only lawful when they point to a currently continuing relationship;
- the latest bill cycle that invoked assessment establishes the current policy UUID in force for the lineage;
- **genesis** (`establish_bill_cycle`) creates `cycle_number = 1` and is lawful only when no cycle exists for the lineage; **advancement** (FEAT-OBL-002) creates the strict successor (`current + 1`) from an existing cycle and never creates cycle 1;
- a terminal bill-cycle row with `next_assessment_at = NULL` stops future recurring assessment for the lineage;
- when the helper is late, the next scheduled run processes the due cycle if it still exists and has not been superseded.

---

## VIII. Derived State

The following SHALL be derived and SHALL NOT be persisted as canonical obligation truth:

- satisfied;
- outstanding;
- past due;
- visible;
- partial payment;
- amount paid;
- amount outstanding;
- days late;
- overpayment handling;
- any mutable lifecycle flag that can be inferred from immutable events.

### Derived evaluation rules

For one assessment:

```text
paid_amount = sum(authoritative Ledger amounts referenced by PAYMENT events for the same correlation_id)
has_waiver = exists(WAIVED for the same correlation_id)

if paid_amount >= assessed_amount:
    status = SATISFIED
elif has_waiver:
    status = SATISFIED
else:
    status = OUTSTANDING
```

Past due is derived as:

```text
status == OUTSTANDING and canonical_now > due_at
```

---

## IX. Operational Rules

1. All obligation mutation SHALL occur through the canonical business operations owned by this domain.
2. GET and read-time logic SHALL remain pure.
3. A bill cycle boundary does not itself mutate canonical truth; it only makes a lawful assessment opportunity eligible.
4. Assessment creation must remain idempotent for the same lawful lineage and correlation.
5. A lawful assessment SHALL NOT be deleted, reversed, or retroactively rewritten.
6. Monetary correction after settlement SHALL occur through Ledger, not by editing obligation history.
7. Insurance cancellation or termination prevents future recurring assessments; it does not rewrite prior obligation events.
8. Rent waiver is lawful only for rent assessments.
9. At a rent boundary, previously granted rent perks expire regardless of whether the current policy UUID remains the same.
10. Current rent is determined by the latest bill cycle that invoked assessment, not by a mutable current flag.
11. A qualifying rent outcome MAY coordinate a Store entitlement grant, but the
    grant is a separate cross-domain effect with `acquisition_type = GRANT`.
    Obligations does not create, count, expire, or otherwise mutate the Store
    entitlement lifecycle.

---

## X. Cross-Domain Coordination

Obligations may consume authoritative inputs from:

- Class Configuration, for rent enablement and class-level economics;
- Policies, for rent settings and other policy definitions;
- Store and Entitlements, for insurance coverage lifecycle inputs and entitlement effects;
- Ledger, for monetary settlement truth.

Obligations does not own those upstream facts.

Where an upstream domain supplies the lawful inputs for an assessment, Obligations records the liability and its resolution while preserving the upstream lineage.

When rent satisfaction or another qualifying rent outcome produces a configured
Store benefit, the coordinating FEAT SHALL invoke the lawful Store grant
surface after evaluating the rent-owned condition. The Store grant is not a
purchase, does not use purchase-limit or overdue-purchase checks, and remains
subject to the product's source-independent holding limit. If the holding limit
prevents the grant, the entitlement grant may fail or be skipped without
rewriting the already-established obligation outcome. The coordination MUST be
idempotent and preserve one correlation lineage across the obligation and any
resulting Store event.
