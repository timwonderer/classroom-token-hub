# Feature Specification Foundation

| Reference Number | Version | Effective Date | Supersedes | Authoritative |
|------------------|---------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| FEAT-ARC-000     | 1.0     | 2026-03-01     | N/A        | YES           |

## I. Purpose
To govern the creation, format, dependencies, and rollout scope of any new user-facing functionality proposed for the application.

## II. Scope
All formal feature proposals targeting additions to UI interfaces, economic parameters, or logical capabilities.

## III. Authority Level
Authoritative (FEAT-ARC Tier). Must not conflict with any ARC or DOM documents. 

## IV. Feature Specification Requirements

### 1. Mandatory Specification Framework
Every submitted FEAT specification must clearly define the following structural segments (observed in standard implementations like Hall Pass):
1. **Canonical Data Model:** Database table impact, fields, enum states, and relationships.
2. **Lifecycle State Machine:** Defined states (e.g. pending, approved, rejected) and forbidden transitions.
3. **Primary User Flow:** Step-by-step persona interactions.
4. **Behavior Rules:** Request-time gating, side effects, constraint checks.
5. **API Surface:** Explicit definitions of GET/POST endpoint contracts.
6. **Observability and Audit:** Minimum events to log and time-stamping behavior.
7. **Security and Privacy Requirements:** `join_code` scoping parameters.

### 2. Constraints
Features may never define behaviors that permit users to perform actions outside of their designated role-bound scopes. (e.g., A teacher cannot access system administration configurations within a classroom feature.)
