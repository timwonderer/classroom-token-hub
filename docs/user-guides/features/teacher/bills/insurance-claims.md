# Insurance Claims

## Overview

A claim is a student asking you to honour the policy they bought. They file it from their side; you decide what it is worth.

The review screen gathers everything you need to make that call in one place: what happened, what the contract they purchased actually promised, how many claims they have already made, and whether this one satisfies the policy's rules.

## Step-by-step instructions

### How a claim reaches you

Students file from their own insurance page against a policy they hold. You do not create claims. Filed claims appear in the **Filed claims** list on **Insurance Management**; select one to open its review screen.

### Reading the review screen

**Claim Details** covers the incident:

| Field | What it tells you |
| --- | --- |
| Student | Who filed |
| Insurance Policy | The product they hold |
| Claim Type | Transaction-based, Non-monetary, or Custom |
| Incident Date | When the thing happened |
| Filed Date | When they submitted |
| Linked Transaction | For transaction claims, the exact ledger entry with its amount |
| Claim Amount | What they are asking for |
| Current Status | Pending, Approved, Rejected, or Paid |

Below that you get the student's **Claim Description** and any **Student Comments**.

**Policy Information** shows the contract as it was sold to that student:

| Field | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Coverage Start | Reads *Still in waiting period* if coverage has not begun |
| Waiting Period | How many days after purchase coverage takes effect |
| Claim Time Limit | How many days from the incident they had to file |
| Max Claim Amount | The per-claim ceiling, or Unlimited |
| Max Claims | How many claims per period, or Unlimited |
| Premium Status | Current, or how many days overdue |
| Remaining Period Cap | How much payout is left in the current period |

**Validation Status** does the arithmetic for you. It either lists the specific rules the claim breaks, or reads **Claim meets all requirements**.

**Student's Claims History** counts their pending, approved, rejected, and paid claims on this policy, and how many of their allowance they have used.

### Deciding

In **Process This Claim**:

1. Set the **Status**.
2. For transaction-based claims, enter the **Approved Amount**. Per-claim and period caps are applied automatically, so you cannot accidentally overpay.
3. If you are rejecting, fill in the **Rejection Reason** — it is required, and the student sees it.
4. Add **Teacher Notes** if you want a record for yourself.
5. Submit.

Approving a monetary claim deposits the approved amount into the student's checking account.

## Important notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The contract is frozen at purchase.** Waiting periods, caps, and limits shown here are the ones in force when that student bought the policy. Editing the policy afterwards does not change their terms. If a student's numbers look different from your current settings, that is why.

> [!NOTE]
> **Check the waiting period first.** A student complaining they cannot claim has usually not reached their coverage start date. The screen tells you outright.

> [!TIP]
> Write the rejection reason for the student, not for your records. It is the only explanation they get, and a specific one ("filed 12 days after the incident; policy allows 7") teaches something. Use Teacher Notes for anything you would not want them to read.
