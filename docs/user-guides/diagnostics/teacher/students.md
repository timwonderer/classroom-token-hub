# Students and Join Codes Troubleshooting

Diagnostic guide for resolving roster syncing, account claiming, and CSV upload errors.

## Student cannot claim an account

### Symptoms
- A student attempts to use a join code but receives an error.
- The system says "Student Not Found" during claim account setup.

### Causes & Solutions
**Cause 1: Wrong join code**
- **Check:** Verify which class period the student is trying to join.
- **Fix:** Join codes are specific to each class period. Provide the code for their exact block.

**Cause 2: Roster data mismatch**
- **Check:** Look at the student's exact roster name for that class.
- **Fix:** The student must type their roster details exactly as they appear for that class to verify the seat claim.

**Cause 3: Seat already claimed**
- **Check:** Check the student list to see if the row already has a linked username.
- **Fix:** If the seat is claimed by the wrong student, you must unlink the account or delete the row and recreate it.

## CSV uploads fail

### Symptoms
- Uploading a class roster CSV results in validation errors or a silent failure.

### Causes & Solutions
**Cause 1: Missing required columns**
- **Check:** Open the CSV in Excel or Notepad.
- **Fix:** Ensure the header matches the current roster template before uploading.

**Cause 2: Name formatting errors**
- **Check:** Look for extra spaces, misspellings, or swapped first/last-name fields.
- **Fix:** Correct the roster names and upload again.

**Cause 3: Duplicate rows**
- **Check:** Look for exact duplicate students in the file.
- **Fix:** Remove duplicate rows, as they create claim conflicts.

## When to Contact Support
Report this issue if:
- Legacy students lose connection to their accounts and the "Claim Students" emergency workflow fails.
- The overall student roster fails to load with a 500 server error.
