# PII Audit for Multi-Tenancy Rollout

We reviewed the multi-tenant data model and request flows to confirm no new personally identifiable information (PII) is stored beyond the existing minimal surface:

- Student identity continues to use encrypted `first_name` plus `last_initial`, with no additional profile fields introduced in the rollout.
- The `student_teachers` association table stores only foreign keys (`student_id`, `admin_id`) and timestamps, adding no PII or credential fields.
- Session state for admins stores role flags and `admin_id` only; no names or student identifiers are persisted in cookies or server-side session data.
- System-admin ownership management routes operate on numeric IDs and do not capture or persist any new PII fields when sharing students across teachers.

Based on this review, the multi-tenancy changes preserve the product goal of storing minimal PII while enabling shared student access for multiple teachers.
