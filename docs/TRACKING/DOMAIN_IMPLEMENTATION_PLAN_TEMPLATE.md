# Domain Implementation Plan Template

**STATUS:** Ephemeral — use this template to create domain-specific implementation plans  
**Scope:** Derived from `PRODUCTION_READINESS_2026-09.md`; destroyed after domain completion  
**Purpose:** Break down a domain's pending SOP-DEV-002 phases into concrete implementation steps

---

## Quick Start

1. **Find your domain in the progress matrix** → note current phase
2. **Copy this template** → rename to `DOMAIN_[NAME]_IMPLEMENTATION_2026-0X-XX.md`
3. **Fill in sections below** for your domain
4. **Create PRs aligned with phase assignments** → each PR advances one or two phases
5. **Delete this plan** after domain reaches Phase 10 (audit certified)

---

## Template: [DOMAIN_NAME] Implementation Plan

**Domain:** [DOM-???-*]  
**Current Phase:** [0-10]  
**Owner:** [Your name]  
**Created:** 2026-08-04  
**Scope:** Advance from current phase to Phase 10 certification

### SOP-DEV-002a Audit Checklist

Use this checklist when you're ready for Phase 10 certification audit.

**Pre-Audit:**
- [ ] All commits are on feature branch
- [ ] Branch is up-to-date with origin/main
- [ ] No uncommitted changes
- [ ] No merge conflicts

**Phase 0: Boundary**
- [ ] Domain spec exists (DOM-* or INV-* authority)
- [ ] Scope is generic (not tied to one entity type)
- [ ] Multi-tenancy model specified (class_id scoping)

**Phase 1: Truth**
- [ ] Canonical fact tables exist

- [ ] Migration upgrade/downgrade tested
- [ ] Foreign key constraints present and enforced
- [ ] No hardcoded constraint names

**Phase 3: Primitives**
- [ ] Core queries implemented in service layer
- [ ] All queries use SQLAlchemy ORM
- [ ] Queries scoped by class_id (multi-tenancy)
- [ ] Unit tests verify operations work
- [ ] Tests include multi-tenancy verification

**Phase 4: Mutation Boundary**
- [ ] All mutations wrapped in FEATContext

**Phase 5: Read Models**
- [ ] View model dataclasses are frozen
- [ ] Constructors are generic (parameterized)
- [ ] Derived state computed at read time
- [ ] Queries scoped by class_id
- [ ] View models tested (happy path, edge cases, multi-tenancy)

**Phase 6: View Model Wiring**
- [ ] Routes construct canonical view models
- [ ] Every field owned by this domain exists in the view model
- [ ] Templates consume only those owned fields
- [ ] No domain-owned field bypasses the view model

**Phase 7: Surface Integration**
- [ ] Every consumer template uses the canonical field
- [ ] Legacy field sources removed
- [ ] Cross-domain dependencies documented
- [ ] Missing dependencies explicitly tracked

**Phase 8: Verify**
- [ ] View model tests pass (happy path, edge cases, multi-tenancy)
- [ ] Multi-tenancy test verifies no cross-class leakage
- [ ] No regression in existing tests
- [ ] Domain operations tested

**Phase 9: Legacy Deletion**
- [ ] Legacy aggregation variables removed
- [ ] Ad-hoc aggregation removed from routes
- [ ] All tests pass after deletion
- [ ] No dangling references

**Phase 10: Audit**
- [ ] Audit document exists
- [ ] Code compiles
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No regressions
- [ ] Branch pushed
- [ ] Git status clean

## View Model Contribution Contract

This domain does not own templates. This domain owns the canonical fields that it contributes to shared view models.

A domain reaches Phase 6-7 when every field it owns:
- Is produced from canonical services (Phase 3)
- Is exposed through canonical view models (Phase 5)
- Is consumed by templates exclusively through those view models (Phase 6)
- Has all legacy field sources removed (Phase 7)

Templates are integration surfaces and are never owned by a single domain. A domain can legitimately reach Phase 7 even if consuming templates are incomplete — what matters is that YOUR fields are wired correctly.

---

### Domain Dependencies

**Architectural Dependencies:**

Depends on:
- [List domains whose services this domain queries]

Blocks:
- [List domains that depend on this domain's canonical fields]

**View Model Contributions:**

This domain owns the following fields in these view models:

| View Model | Field | Authority | Current Status |
|------------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| [ViewModelName] | [field_name] | [This Domain] | 🔄 [Phase 0-7] |
| [ViewModelName] | [field_name] | [This Domain] | ✅ [Phase 7 complete] |

Example:
| StudentDashboardView | balance | Ledger | ✅ Phase 7 |
| StudentDashboardView | current_rent_due | Obligations | 🔄 Phase 6 (wired, not yet template-verified) |
| StudentDashboardView | next_payday | Payroll | ⏳ Phase 0 (not started) |

**Unresolved View Model Dependencies:**

(Track which fields from OTHER domains this domain depends on, and their completion status)

| View Model | Field | Authority | Status | Impact |
|------------|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| [MyViewModelName] | [field] | [Other Domain] | 🔄 | [What breaks if missing] |

Example:
| StudentPayrollView | class_timezone | Class Config | ✅ | Payroll calculation accuracy |
| StudentPayrollView | current_period_number | Obligations | 🔄 | Payroll cycle alignment |

---

### View Model Field Ownership

This table is the authoritative tracking for Phase 6-7 completion. A domain reaches Phase 7 when ALL owned fields are ✅.

| View Model | Field | Service (Phase 3) | View Model (Phase 5) | Route Passes (Phase 6) | Template Uses (Phase 7) | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| [ModelName] | [field] | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Complete |
| [ModelName] | [field] | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🔄 | Template work in progress |
| [ModelName] | [field] | ✅ | ✅ | ⏳ | ⏳ | Route wiring pending |

**What each column means:**
- **Service (Phase 3):** Canonical service method exists and returns data
- **View Model (Phase 5):** Field is defined in view model; constructor sets it from canonical service
- **Route Passes (Phase 6):** Route constructs view model and passes to template
- **Template Uses (Phase 7):** Template accesses field through view model, legacy sources removed

**Phase 7 Verification:** For each row, verify template code uses ONLY `{{ view_model.field }}`, not `{{ legacy_variable }}` or `{{ computed_inline }}`

2. Run `git revert [PR-commit]`
3. Diagnose root cause
4. Fix and re-test locally
5. Create new PR with fix
6. Update this plan with lessons learned
