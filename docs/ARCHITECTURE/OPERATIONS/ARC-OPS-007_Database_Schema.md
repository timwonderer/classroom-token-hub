# ARC-OPS-007: Database Schema Documentation

| Reference Number | Version | Effective Date | Supersedes | Authority Level |
|------------------|---------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| ARC-OPS-007      | 1.4     | 2026-04-18     | 1.3        | Constitutional  |

## I. Purpose

This document summarizes the current database contract for v2.0 live-test work, with emphasis on class-scoping authority, identity infrastructure, and analytics/observability support.

It is not the canonical field-by-field schema authority for every table. Under the V2 authority model, schema contracts belong to the owning domain documentation, and cross-domain relationship semantics belong in architecture documentation. This document is therefore a runtime table index and ownership overview, not a replacement for domain-owned schema contracts.

## II. Scope

This document covers the runtime-significant models and tables used to enforce class isolation, teacher identity, and core student/admin workflows.

It must not be used to duplicate or redefine a table contract that is already owned by a domain document.

## III. Schema Authority Rule

- Every runtime table must have exactly one owning domain.
- Field definitions and constraints belong in that owning domain's schema contract.
- Architecture documents may describe cross-domain reference semantics, but not shared ownership.
- This document remains useful as a navigation and runtime-orientation layer only.

## IV. Core Authority Model

### Class Boundary

- `class_economies.join_code` is the class boundary.
- `class_economies.class_id` is the internal class authority key.
- `class_memberships` is the authority table for membership inside that boundary.
- `student_teachers` remains the teacher-student ownership table, but it is not the class-boundary authority.
- Session class selection is represented by `current_join_code`.

## V. Key Tables

### `class_economies`

Represents the canonical class anchor.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `class_id` | UUID/String(36), unique | Internal class authority key |
| `join_code` | String(20), PK | Public class join token |
| `teacher_id` | Integer | Owning teacher |
| `display_name` | String(100), nullable | Human-readable class name |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | DateTime | UTC timestamps |
| `created_by_admin_id` | Integer, nullable | Creation audit pointer |

Lifecycle rule:
- row exists = class exists
- row deleted = class is gone
- there is no archived/inactive class state in v2

### `class_memberships`

Represents admin or student membership in a class economy.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Integer, PK | Membership row |
| `join_code` | String(20), FK | FK to `class_economies.join_code` |
| `admin_id` | Integer, nullable | FK to `teachers.id`; used for teacher memberships |
| `student_id` | Integer, nullable | FK to `students.id`; used for student memberships |
| `role` | Enum(`admin`, `student`) | Runtime role |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | DateTime | UTC timestamps |

Constraints:
- unique (`join_code`, `admin_id`)
- unique (`join_code`, `student_id`)
- XOR check: exactly one of `admin_id` or `student_id` must be set
- membership row existence is the active-state contract; there is no archived membership state

### `teachers`

Teacher/admin accounts.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Integer, PK | Internal primary key |
| `username` | String(80), nullable | Legacy plaintext username; transitional only |
| `username_hash` | String(64), nullable | Hashed auth username |
| `username_lookup_hash` | String(64), nullable | Deterministic login lookup hash |
| `teacher_public_id` | String(120), unique, nullable | Stable public teacher identifier |
| `display_name` | Encrypted string, nullable | Teacher-facing/student-facing display label |
| `hall_pass_verify_token` | String(64), unique, nullable | Older public verification capability token |
| `totp_secret` | String(200) | Encrypted-at-rest TOTP secret |

Runtime note:
- `Admin.public_id` is a SQLAlchemy synonym for `teacher_public_id`.

### Identity and onboarding support tables

These models are active parts of the runtime identity layer:

- `users` - generalized user container used by the newer identity layer
- `identity_profiles` - centralized encrypted person-name identity records
- `seats` - normalized claimed/unclaimed class seat records
- `admin_invite_codes` - teacher signup invite mechanism
- `teacher_onboarding` - persisted onboarding progress and widget state

### `student_teachers`

Teacher ownership linkage for students.

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Integer, PK | Link row |
| `student_id` | Integer | FK to `students.id` |
| `teacher_id` | Integer | FK to `teachers.id` |
| `created_at` | DateTime | UTC timestamp |

Runtime note:
- Ownership and class access are related but distinct. Ownership comes from `student_teachers`; class access comes from `class_memberships`.
- `admin_id` still exists as a synonym alias in the ORM for compatibility only.

### `students`

Student record and credential container.

Important fields:
- `id`
- encrypted identity fields
- `identity_id`
- `block`
- `join_code` / `class_id`
- `salt`, `first_half_hash`, `second_half_hash`
- `username_hash`, `username_lookup_hash`
- recovery fields and second-factor settings
- opaque/internal reference fields for non-PII workflows

Runtime note:
- Student financial and class-scoped reads must be interpreted through `join_code` and membership context, not the legacy global aggregate assumptions.

### `balance_cache`

Posted-balance snapshot table used for efficient balance reads.

Important fields:
- `student_id`
- `seat_id`
- `join_code`
- `posted_checking_balance_cents`
- `posted_savings_balance_cents`
- `last_settlement_at`

Runtime note:
- This table is central to ledger settlement. Student balances are not stored on `StudentBlock`.

### `payroll_cache`

Cached payroll breakdown by class scope.

Important fields:
- `teacher_id`
- `join_code`
- `class_id`
- `cached_breakdown`
- `last_calculated_at`

### `feature_settings`

Class-scoped economy policy settings.

Important fields:
- `teacher_id`
- `join_code`
- `class_id`
- `economy_policy_mode`
- rebalance audit fields

Feature enablement no longer lives here.

### `class_features`

Class-scoped feature enablement table.

Important fields:
- `class_id`
- `feature_name`

Contract:
- row exists = feature enabled for that class
- row missing = feature disabled for that class

### `announcements`

Shared announcement table for both teacher-authored and sysadmin-authored messages.

Important fields:
- `teacher_id`
- `system_admin_id`
- `join_code`
- `audience_type`
- `target_teacher_id`
- `is_active`, `priority`, `expires_at`

Runtime note:
- Teachers can author class-scoped announcements in `/admin/announcements/*`.
- Sysadmins can author broader announcements in `/sysadmin/announcements/*`.

### `analytics_*`

Analytics storage models backing the teacher analytics surface.

- `analytics_alerts` tracks alert state and acknowledgement lifecycle
- `analytics_snapshots` stores precomputed metrics per class/window
- `analytics_events` stores contextual events rendered alongside analytics data

### Issue and observability tables

Support and monitoring infrastructure includes:

- `issues`
- `issue_categories`
- `ticket_correlation_packs`
- `issue_status_history`
- `issue_resolution_actions`
- `error_logs`
- `actor_request_traces`
- `error_events`
- `user_reports`

### Class-Scoped Transactional Tables

These tables rely on `join_code` as their class boundary and must not be treated as teacher-global in v2 flows:

- `transactions`
- `tap_events`
- `student_blocks`
- `hall_pass_logs`
- `rent_payments`
- `rent_waivers`
- `student_items`
- `student_insurance`
- `insurance_claims`

Many of these tables also carry transitional fields such as `teacher_id`, `seat_id`, or historical block references. Those fields may remain useful for migration or reporting, but `join_code` is the class-isolation authority for current v2 runtime behavior.

## V. Migration Notes

- `c5a7dedeca47_add_collective_goal_instance_code.py` adds `collective_goal_instance_code` to `store_items` and `student_items` to scope collective goal tracking natively avoiding progress bleed upon reactivation.
- `a11213ca4afb_harden_class_economy_membership_checks.py` hardens `ClassEconomy` / `ClassMembership` enum and check-constraint behavior.
- `e8f1a2b3c4d5_merge_remaining_v2_heads.py` resolves the remaining active v2 migration heads in repo.

## VI. Current Transitional Fields and Aliases

These remain intentionally present but should not be used to define new v2 behavior:

- `Admin.public_id` -> synonym for `teacher_public_id`
- legacy plaintext `username` fields on `teachers` and `system_admins`

## VII. v2 Contract Summary

- `ClassEconomy` + `ClassMembership` define class scope.
- `student_teachers` defines teacher ownership.
- `current_join_code` defines selected class context in session.
- Public teacher identity is `teacher_public_id` / `public_id`, not numeric teacher ID.
- Compatibility aliases remain in schema and ORM, but they are transitional.

## VIII. Amendment
Revisions to this document require incrementing the version number, updating the Effective Date, and populating the Supersedes field.
