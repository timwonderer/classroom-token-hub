# Template Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-02-18  
**Scope:** `templates/` directory  
**Goal:** Verify design-system unification and identify remaining non-compliant patterns.

## Summary

| Category | Status |
|---|---|
| Template icon system | Complete migration to Material Symbols |
| Opacity utility legacy patterns | Removed (`bg-opacity-*` eliminated) |
| Hardcoded inline color literals in style contexts | Removed from audited template styling paths |
| Recovery/claim standalone styling parity | Fixed (`tokens.css` included where missing) |

## Completed Work

1. Replaced legacy Bootstrap icon markup (`<i class="bi ...">`) with Material Symbols across template files.
2. Updated JS-rendered icon strings to use Material Symbols for consistent runtime states.
3. Removed Bootstrap icon stylesheet dependencies from template heads.
4. Replaced opacity hacks (`bg-*-opacity-*`) with semantic subtle classes (`bg-*-subtle`).
5. Replaced hardcoded template color literals in style contexts with design-token/semantic values.
6. Fixed standalone recovery/claim templates that referenced token variables without loading `tokens.css`.
7. Corrected recovery shell class usage to ensure role-based theme tokens resolve correctly (`student-shell`).

## Validation Notes

- Grep checks were used to verify absence of:
  - `bi-*` icon usage in templates
  - `bg-opacity-*` utility usage
  - hardcoded color literals in styling contexts
- Recovery-related render tests were run after fixes:
  - `tests/test_student_recovery.py`
  - `tests/test_teacher_recovery.py`

## Current Status

The template layer is now aligned with `docs/development/design_system.md` and uses unified styling conventions across teacher, student, sysadmin, and standalone recovery/claim surfaces.
