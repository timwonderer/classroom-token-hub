# INV-ARC-006: Command Boundary for Mutation

| Reference Number | Version | Effective Date | Supersedes | Authority Level |
|------------------|---------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| INV-ARC-006      | 1.0     | 2026-04-13     | N/A        | Foundational    |

## I. Purpose

Define the mutation boundary for all runtime behavior.

## II. Scope

Applies to all state mutation.

## III. Authority Level

Foundational within `INV-ARC`. Derived from `INV-CORE-000` and `INV-ARC-000`.

## IV. Dependencies

- `INV-ARC-003_SCOPED_CAPABILITY_EVALUATION.md`

## V. Core Rule

All state mutation MUST occur inside explicit domain commands.

Mutation during:

- capability evaluation
- query execution
- request rendering

is forbidden.

## VI. Rebuild Intent

This rule exists to eliminate hidden writes in reads, feature-layer mutation shortcuts,
and cross-domain side effects disguised as helper behavior.

## VII. Downstream Consequence

`DOM` must own explicit mutation commands, and `FEAT` must never mutate state outside
those commands.

## VIII. Amendment

Revisions must preserve explicit command-only mutation.
