# V2 Canonical Auth Runtime Cutover

**Status:** Implemented (Wave 3C.12-H)
**Effective Date:** 2026-06-08

## Purpose

This document records the runtime identity/auth contract during the v2 cutover. It
does not replace the constitutional identity docs. It explains how the current code
must behave while deprecated v1 tables still exist for route compatibility.

## Canonical Runtime Authority

The active authority chain is:

```text
users.id
  authenticates the human principal

seats.id + classes.class_id
  authorizes class-local actor behavior

identity_profiles
  displays the actor
```

`User` authenticates. `Seat` acts. `Class` scopes. `IdentityProfile` displays.

Deprecated tables such as `Student`, `Admin`, `SystemAdmin`, `TeacherBlock`, and
principal-based `ClassMembership` rows are not authoritative identity sources.

## Credential Ownership

`users` owns all credential verification:

- teacher username lookup and TOTP verification
- sysadmin username lookup and TOTP verification
- student username lookup and PIN verification
- student passphrase verification
- session nonce and expiry state
- recovery capability
- passkey capability

Passkey metadata may remain in compatibility tables while the bridge exists:

- `teacher_credentials.user_id`
- `system_admin_credentials.user_id`

Those rows are credential metadata only. Legacy `teacher_id` and `sysadmin_id` values
on those rows are route compatibility shadows.

Passwordless external IDs must use:

```text
user_<User.id>
```

Legacy external IDs such as `admin_<id>` and `sysadmin_<id>` are invalid v2
principals and must fail closed.

## Session Contract

The session anchor is `session["user_id"]`.

Compatibility session keys may still exist:

- `session["admin_id"]`
- `session["student_id"]`
- `session["sysadmin_id"]`

These keys may only be populated after resolving the canonical `User` and loading the
legacy route shadow owned by that user. They are not authentication authority and must
not be accepted as substitutes for `user_id`.

Class-scoped behavior must resolve:

```text
user_id + class_id + seat_id
```

`join_code` may appear at the boundary for entry, routing, or display, but it must
resolve to `class_id` before authority-sensitive work.

## Roster Provisioning

Roster upload creates a future participant position inside a class universe. It does
not create an authenticated student.

The provisioning contract is:

1. A class exists or is created.
2. A `User` row is provisioned as an inactive authentication shell.
3. A `Seat` row is provisioned and bound to the class.
4. An `IdentityProfile` row is provisioned and bound one-to-one to the seat.
5. Claim artifacts are stored on the seat.
6. No authentication credentials are activated.

Claim first-name and last-name lookup hashes belong on `Seat`, because they prove
entitlement to one class-local participant position. They do not identify a human
globally and they do not belong in `IdentityProfile`.

## Recovery Ownership

Recovery is a user-owned capability with a lifecycle. Canonical durable recovery
state belongs in `user_recovery_tokens`, not on `users` as a growing set of
one-off columns.

Recovery token lifecycle state includes:

- `created_at`
- `expires_at`
- `used_at`
- `revoked_at`
- `issued_by`

Short-lived teacher-visible reset-code fields may remain during the migration bridge,
but successful recovery must replace canonical credential hashes on `users`.

## Display Identity Boundary

`IdentityProfile` is presentation-only.

It may contain:

- preferred display name fields
- initials or display-safe labels
- presentation metadata

It must not contain:

- credential hashes
- passkey metadata
- recovery tokens
- claim lookup hashes
- class authority
- financial authority

## Remaining Bridge Debt

The following residue is allowed only as compatibility debt:

- legacy principal rows used by route templates
- legacy session IDs derived from canonical `User`
- `TeacherBlock` roster mirrors
- principal IDs on class membership rows
- credential metadata role IDs beside canonical `user_id`

The bridge retirement path is to remove consumers after every credential, recovery,
class-scope, and display path resolves from `User + Seat + Class`.
