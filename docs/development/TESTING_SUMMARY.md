# Multi-Tenancy Testing Summary

**Branch**: `claude/fix-multi-tenancy-leaks-015yz9WmT5SE8EFgAzU8Au32`
**Date**: 2025-11-29
**Status**:  READY FOR STAGING DEPLOYMENT

---

##  What Was Fixed

### Phase 1: Cross-Teacher Isolation
- **Commit**: `5bcad94`
- **Issue**: Students enrolled with different teachers saw combined data
- **Fix**: Added `teacher_id` to all transactions and queries

### Phase 2: Same-Teacher Multi-Period Isolation  **CRITICAL**
- **Commit**: `84a1f12`
- **Issue**: Students with same teacher in different periods saw combined data
- **Fix**: Added `join_code` to Transaction model and ALL queries
- **Architecture Change**: `join_code` is now the absolute source of truth

---

##  Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment (Local/Dev)
```bash
# Ensure you're on the correct branch
git checkout claude/fix-multi-tenancy-leaks-015yz9WmT5SE8EFgAzU8Au32

# Pull latest (already done)
git pull origin claude/fix-multi-tenancy-leaks-015yz9WmT5SE8EFgAzU8Au32

# Review the changes
cat JOIN_CODE_FIX_SUMMARY.md
```

### 2. Staging Deployment
```bash
# Deploy code to staging server
# (Your deployment process here)

# Run database migration
flask db upgrade

# Seed test data
python seed_multi_tenancy_test_data.py

# Verify migration
flask shell
>>> from app.models import Transaction
>>> Transaction.query.filter(Transaction.join_code.isnot(None)).count()
# Should show transactions with join_code

# Check credentials
cat TEST_CREDENTIALS.txt
```

### 3. Initial Validation
Run these quick SQL checks:
```sql
-- Check join_code column exists
\d transaction

-- Count transactions with join_code
SELECT
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE join_code IS NOT NULL) as with_join_code,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE join_code IS NULL) as without_join_code,
    COUNT(*) as total
FROM transaction;

-- View join code distribution
SELECT join_code, COUNT(*) as count
FROM transaction
WHERE join_code IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY join_code
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### 4. Critical Test Cases

**MOST IMPORTANT**: Test same-teacher multi-period isolation

#### Test Case 1: Emma Evans (Same Teacher, Different Periods)
```
Student: Emma Evans
Username: emmae2009
Password: E2009

Enrolled in:
- ms_johnson Period A (English 1st Period)
- ms_johnson Period B (English 3rd Period)

Expected Behavior:
1. Login as Emma
2. Select Period A → See balance X, transactions from Period A only
3. Switch to Period B → See balance Y (DIFFERENT!), transactions from Period B only
4. No mixing of data between periods

 PASS: Balances are isolated, transactions filtered correctly
 FAIL: Balances combined or transactions mixed
```

#### Test Case 2: Grace Garcia (Same Teacher, Different Periods)
```
Student: Grace Garcia
Username: graceg2008
Password: G2008

Enrolled in:
- mr_smith Period A (Math Period 1)
- mr_smith Period D (Math Period 4)

Same test as above - verify isolation
```

#### Test Case 3: Carol Chen (Different Teachers)
```
Student: Carol Chen
Username: carolc2007
Password: C2007

Enrolled in:
- ms_johnson Period A
- mr_smith Period A

Expected: Complete isolation between teachers' classes
```

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

Follow the workflow in `SEEDING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:

1.  Database verification (SQL queries)
2.  Single-period students (control group)
3.  **CRITICAL**: Same-teacher multi-period students
4.  Multiple-teacher students
5.  Feature testing (store, insurance, transfers, rent)
6.  Edge cases (rapid switching, session management)

### 6. Success Criteria

Must see ALL of these:
-  All new transactions have join_code populated
-  Balances calculated per join_code (not aggregated)
-  Transactions filtered by current join_code
-  Switching periods changes visible data
-  Same student can have different balances in different periods
-  No cross-period data leakage
-  No cross-teacher data leakage
-  Session correctly tracks current_join_code
-  Store items respect block visibility
-  Insurance policies respect block visibility

---

##  Validation Queries

### Check All Transactions Have join_code
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transaction WHERE join_code IS NULL;
-- Expected: 0 (for new transactions after migration)
```

### Verify join_code Matches Student Enrollments
```sql
SELECT
    t.id,
    t.description,
    t.join_code as tx_join_code,
    tb.join_code as enrollment_join_code,
    CASE
        WHEN t.join_code = tb.join_code THEN 'MATCH '
        ELSE 'MISMATCH '
    END as status
FROM transaction t
JOIN teacher_blocks tb ON t.student_id = tb.student_id AND t.join_code = tb.join_code
WHERE t.join_code IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 20;
```

### View Student Balances Per Period
```sql
SELECT
    s.first_name || ' ' || s.last_initial || '.' as student,
    a.username as teacher,
    tb.block as period,
    tb.join_code,
    SUM(CASE WHEN t.account_type = 'checking' AND NOT t.is_void THEN t.amount ELSE 0 END) as checking_balance,
    SUM(CASE WHEN t.account_type = 'savings' AND NOT t.is_void THEN t.amount ELSE 0 END) as savings_balance,
    COUNT(t.id) as transaction_count
FROM students s
JOIN teacher_blocks tb ON s.id = tb.student_id
JOIN admins a ON tb.teacher_id = a.id
LEFT JOIN transaction t ON s.id = t.student_id AND t.join_code = tb.join_code
WHERE tb.is_claimed = true
GROUP BY s.id, s.first_name, s.last_initial, a.username, tb.block, tb.join_code
ORDER BY s.first_name, a.username, tb.block;
```

### Find Students with Multiple Periods (Critical Test Cases)
```sql
SELECT
    s.first_name || ' ' || s.last_initial || '.' as student,
    a.username as teacher,
    COUNT(DISTINCT tb.block) as period_count,
    STRING_AGG(tb.block || ' (join: ' || tb.join_code || ')', ', ') as periods
FROM students s
JOIN teacher_blocks tb ON s.id = tb.student_id
JOIN admins a ON tb.teacher_id = a.id
WHERE tb.is_claimed = true
GROUP BY s.id, s.first_name, s.last_initial, a.username
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT tb.block) > 1
ORDER BY period_count DESC, a.username;
```

##  Expected Database State After Seeding

```
Teachers: 4
Students: 15
Class Periods: 10 (unique join codes)
Student Enrollments: ~25 (some students in multiple classes)
Transactions: ~250
  - With join_code: ~250 (100%)
  - Without join_code: 0
Store Items: ~45
Insurance Policies: ~18
Student Insurance: ~10
Insurance Claims: ~3
Payroll Settings: 10 (one per period)
Rent Settings: 10 (one per period)
```

---

##  Red Flags (If Any of These Occur, DO NOT DEPLOY)

1.  Transactions created without join_code
2.  Student sees combined balance from multiple periods (same teacher)
3.  Transactions from different periods showing together
4.  Balance doesn't change when switching periods
5.  Session loses join_code after navigation
6.  SQL queries show join_code mismatches
7.  Store items showing from wrong period
8.  Insurance visible in wrong period

---

##  Green Lights (Safe to Deploy)

1.  All seeded transactions have join_code
2.  Multi-period students see isolated balances per period
3.  Switching periods changes visible transactions
4.  SQL verification queries pass
5.  Manual testing of critical cases successful
6.  No errors in application logs
7.  Session management working correctly
8.  Store/insurance visibility correct

---

##  If Issues Arise

### Database Issues
- Check migration was applied: `flask db current`
- Verify join_code column: `\d transaction` in psql
- Check indexes: Look for `ix_transaction_join_code`

### Application Issues
- Check logs for errors
- Verify session has `current_join_code`
- Check `get_current_class_context()` returns correct data

### Data Issues
- Run SQL verification queries above
- Check if transactions missing join_code
- Verify student enrollments in teacher_blocks

### Quick Rollback Plan
If critical issues found:
1. Do NOT run in production yet
2. Document the specific issue
3. Check if it's a deployment issue or code issue
4. May need to create backfill script for existing data

##  Key Learnings

1. **Join code is the absolute source of truth**
   - Each join code = unique class economy
   - Teacher can have multiple periods with different join codes
   - Students switch between join codes, not teachers

2. **Every transaction MUST have join_code**
   - Required for proper isolation
   - Filters all queries by current join_code
   - Balance calculations scoped per join_code

3. **Session management is critical**
   - Must store `current_join_code`
   - Must resolve to full context on each request
   - Must validate join_code belongs to student
