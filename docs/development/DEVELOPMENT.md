## Static Assets and Cache Busting

- Always reference CSS/JS/images in templates with `static_url('<path>')` so Flask appends a file timestamp query parameter.
- Avoid hard-coding `/static/...` paths or `url_for('static', ...)` in templates; the helper prevents browsers/CDNs from serving stale assets after deployments.

## Development Priorities (v1.3)

### 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. Multi-Teacher Hardening
**Status:** In progress (sharing + scoped queries shipped)

**Remaining Tasks:**
- [ ] Finalize migration to remove legacy `students.teacher_id` (deprecated in models)
- [ ] Publish runbook for NOT NULL enforcement / teacher reassignment
- [ ] Audit for direct `Student.query.get` outside scoped helpers → replace with `get_student_for_admin`
- [ ] Add DB safeguard for ownership changes (define ON DELETE strategy)

**Context:** The `student_teachers` link table is the authoritative ownership model. Join codes partition class economies.

#### 2. Shared-Student Test Coverage
**Status:** Pending

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add pytest coverage for payroll flows with students linked to multiple teachers
- [ ] Add pytest coverage for attendance flows with shared students
- [ ] Add DB-level uniqueness regression test for `student_teachers` constraint

#### 3. Operational Safety Documentation
**Status:** Pending

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create runbook for schema changes affecting tenancy or payroll
- [ ] Document pre/post checks for migrations with maintenance mode
- [ ] Establish migration validation checklist

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 1. Admin Experience Polish
- [ ] System-admin filters to view students by primary/shared teachers
- [ ] Clearer UI messaging when acting on shared students
- [ ] Payroll scope hints in transaction history

#### 2. Data Export Capabilities
- [ ] CSV exports for rosters
- [ ] CSV exports for transactions
- [ ] CSV exports for attendance history
- [ ] CSV exports for payroll history
- [ ] CSV exports for store purchases

#### 3. Mobile & Accessibility
- [x] Responsive navigation for admin portal (completed v1.2.0)
- [x] Responsive navigation for student portal (completed v1.2.0)
- [x] Larger touch targets for tap in/out (completed v1.2.0)
- [x] Larger touch targets for store interactions (completed v1.2.0)
- [x] ARIA labels for key buttons and forms (completed v1.2.0)
- [x] Accessibility improvements following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines (completed v1.2.0)
- [x] PWA support with offline capabilities (completed v1.2.0)
- [x] Mobile-optimized templates (completed v1.2.0)

### 🟢 LOWER PRIORITY

- [ ] Enhanced student dashboard insights (balance history, projected earnings)
- [ ] Performance profiling for large rosters (pagination partial; continue optimization)
- [ ] Optional email notifications for teacher/system-admin events

## Known Issues (P2 and below)

- SQLAlchemy `Query.get` usage still surfaces `LegacyAPIWarning` during tests. Refactor to `Session.get`/scoped helper calls once compatibility with existing tenancy helpers is revalidated.

### Planned Features (Future Releases)

#### 1. In-App Communication & Announcements (v1.5+)
**Status:** Documented, not yet implemented
**Documentation:** `docs/development/SYSADMIN_INTERFACE_DESIGN.md` (Section 6)

**Features:**
- **System-wide announcements** - Broadcast messages to all users
- **Maintenance notifications** - Automated alerts for scheduled maintenance
- **Emergency alerts** - Critical system messages with priority display
- **Message to all teachers** - Admin communication tool
- **Message to all students** - Class-wide or system-wide student messaging

**Route:** `/sysadmin/announcements` (System Admin)

**Use Cases:**
- Notify all users of upcoming maintenance
- Emergency closure announcements
- System-wide policy updates
- Teacher communication for multi-school deployments

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 weeks
**Priority:** Medium (useful for multi-school deployments)

#### 2. Teacher Self-Serve Account Recovery (Future)
**Status:** Documented, deferred due to security complexity
**Documentation:** `docs/development/SYSADMIN_INTERFACE_DESIGN.md` (mentions TOTP reset)

**Problem:** Teachers who lose access to their TOTP authenticator app are locked out of their accounts. Currently requires sysadmin intervention.

**Security Challenge:** Self-serve recovery requires storing additional sensitive information, which conflicts with the platform's minimal-PII philosophy.

**Potential Approaches:**
- **Backup codes** (one-time use) - Requires secure storage and user safekeeping
- **Recovery email** - Additional PII to protect, phishing risk
- **Security questions** - Generally weak security, social engineering risk
- **SMS verification** - More PII, SIM-swapping attacks
- **Printable recovery key** - User responsibility to secure physical key

**Current Workaround:** System admins can reset teacher TOTP via `/sysadmin` interface (planned feature)

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks (implementation) + security review
**Priority:** Medium (nice-to-have, but sysadmin reset is acceptable)
**Blocker:** Requires decision on acceptable security/PII tradeoffs

**Recommendation:** Defer until v1.5+ and prioritize sysadmin-assisted TOTP reset as the primary recovery path.

#### 3. Custom Condition Builder (v1.5+)
**Status:** Research completed, deferred to future release

**Description:** Drag-and-drop visual rule builder for custom conditional logic in rent, insurance, store, payroll, and banking features.

**Use Case:** Teachers could define custom triggers like "IF checking balance < $50 AND no insurance THEN charge $5 late fee"

**Implementation Options:**
- Phase 1: JSON-based rules engine with simple form builder (4-6 weeks)
- Phase 2: Enhanced drag-and-drop UI with SortableJS (2-3 weeks)
- Phase 3: Full Blockly integration for visual programming (4-6 weeks)

**Rationale for Deferral:** Power-user feature, not critical for core functionality; prioritize high-demand features first

**Estimated Effort:** 12-18 weeks for full implementation

#### 4. Jobs Feature (v1.5+)
**Status:** Partially implemented, then removed; awaiting completion
**Git History:** Started in commit `0800640`, removed in commit `a04b574` (2025-12-10)

**Description:** Classroom job market system allowing teachers to create job opportunities for students, teaching work ethic and providing earning opportunities beyond attendance-based payroll.

**Two Job Types:**

1. **Employee Jobs** - Long-term positions with regular pay
   - Application and approval process required
   - Regular salary payments (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Multiple vacancy slots per job
   - Job requirements and qualifications
   - Termination system with notice periods, warnings, and penalties
   - Teacher can fire employees with configurable consequences

2. **Contract Jobs** - One-off bounties, first-come-first-served
   - No application required; students claim available contracts
   - Single bounty payment upon completion
   - Quick turnaround for short-term tasks
   - Teacher marks as complete to trigger payment

**Database Models Created:**
- `JobTemplate` - Reusable job definitions in the teacher's job bank
- `Job` - Instance of a template assigned to a specific period/block
- `JobApplication` - Student applications for employee positions
- `JobEmployee` - Active employment relationships
- `JobContract` - Contract job assignments and completions

**Features Implemented Before Removal:**
- Job bank management for teachers (create/edit templates)
- Job assignment to specific class periods via join_code
- Application system for employee positions
- Contract claiming interface
- Payment processing integration with transactions
- Termination system with warnings and penalties
- Comprehensive test coverage (test files removed with feature)
- Admin routes (`app/routes/admin_jobs.py`, 514 lines)
- Flask forms for all job operations

**Use Cases:**
- **Classroom Helper:** Student job as "Board Eraser" earning $5/week
- **Technology Assistant:** "Chromebook Manager" earning $10/week
- **Project Bounties:** "Design Class Poster" contract for $25 one-time
- **Teaching Work Ethic:** Students learn reliability, job performance, consequences of termination
- **Earning Diversity:** Income beyond attendance, rewarding contribution and responsibility

**Why It Was Removed:**
- Removed during feature cleanup (commit a04b574)
- Only merge migration kept to maintain migration chain integrity
- Code preserved in git history for future reimplementation

**Remaining Work for Completion:**
- [ ] Restore models from commit `0800640`
- [ ] Restore admin routes from commit `e2de8bd`
- [ ] Restore Flask forms from commit `c9378b7`
- [ ] Restore test coverage from commit `8a1b0bd`
- [ ] Update for current join_code scoping patterns
- [ ] Add student-facing job board interface
- [ ] Add application submission and tracking UI
- [ ] Implement contract claiming interface
- [ ] Add job performance tracking (optional: attendance link)
- [ ] Create teacher analytics for job market health

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 weeks (restoration + modernization + UI polish)
**Priority:** Medium (valuable feature, but not critical for 1.0)
**Complexity:** High (payroll integration, multi-state workflows, termination rules)

**Git References:**
- `0800640` - Add jobs feature database models and migration
- `c9378b7` - Add Flask forms for jobs feature
- `e2de8bd` - Add admin routes for jobs feature (514 lines)
- `8a1b0bd` - Add comprehensive tests and documentation for jobs feature
- `a04b574` - Remove jobs feature code, keep only merge migration

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture

### Current State

#### Join Code as Source of Truth
- **Class Isolation:** Join codes partition transactions/attendance between class periods
- **Student Sessions:** Persist `current_join_code` to scope balances/transactions per class
- **Authoritative Model:** `student_teachers` link table enforces ownership
- **Deprecated:** `students.teacher_id` is ignored by access control helpers

#### Access Control
- **Scoped Helpers:** `get_admin_student_query`, `get_student_for_admin` in `app/auth.py`
- **Admin Routes:** Use scoped helpers exclusively (avoid direct `Student.query`)
- **System Admins:** Global visibility across all students and teachers
- **Teacher Isolation:** Each teacher sees only their linked students

#### Database Constraints
- **Uniqueness:** `student_teachers` enforces (`student_id`, `admin_id`) unique constraint
- **Cascading:** Deletes cascade properly through relationships
- **Join Code:** NOT NULL enforcement pending after backfill verification

### Migration Strategy

When ready to finalize multi-teacher model:

1. **Pre-checks:**
   - Verify every student has ≥1 `student_teachers` row
   - Identify orphaned student records
   - Audit direct `Student.query` usage in codebase

2. **Maintenance Banner:**
   - Enable maintenance mode during migration if medium/high risk
   - Use `MAINTENANCE_MODE=true` environment variable

3. **Migration Execution:**
   - Drop/lock `students.teacher_id` after dependency verification
   - Ensure foreign keys optimized for scoped queries
   - Enforce `join_code` NOT NULL on ledger tables

4. **Post-checks:**
   - Smoke tests on admin/student portals
   - Validate payroll/attendance with shared students
   - Verify no routes bypass scoped helpers

---

## Code Quality Standards

### Authentication & Authorization
- Prefer scoped helpers (`get_admin_student_query`, `get_student_for_admin`) over ad-hoc filters
- Always check `is_system_admin` for global access requirements
- Use `@admin_required` and `@system_admin_required` decorators consistently

### Database Best Practices
- **Migrations:** Always sync with main before creating new migrations
- **Queries:** Use scoped helpers for tenant-aware access
- **Timestamps:** Use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` (not deprecated `utcnow()`)
- **Session Access:** Use `db.session.get(Model, id)` (not deprecated `Model.query.get()`)

### Security Guidelines
- Keep PII minimal (prefer non-PII identifiers, encrypted first names)
- Validate all user input at route level
- Use CSRF protection on all forms
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Avoid adding debug print statements to production code

### Testing Requirements
- Run `pytest -q` before committing
- Add tests for new features and bug fixes
- Focus tests for tenancy helpers when changing scoping logic
- Ensure foreign key constraints enabled in tests

---

## Development Workflow

### Before Creating Migrations

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Always follow this workflow to prevent multiple heads:**

1. **Sync with latest code:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   git merge origin/main
   ```

2. **Verify exactly ONE migration head:**
   ```bash
   flask db heads  # Must show exactly 1 head
   ```

3. **If multiple heads exist, merge them first:**
   ```bash
   flask db merge heads -m "Merge migration heads"
   ```

4. **Check current revision:**
   ```bash
   flask db current
   ```

5. **Create migration:**
   ```bash
   flask db migrate -m "Clear description"
   ```

6. **Verify new migration:**
   - Open generated file in `migrations/versions/`
   - Verify `down_revision` matches `flask db current` output
   - If mismatch, DELETE migration and restart workflow

7. **Test migration:**
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade    # Apply
   flask db downgrade  # Rollback
   flask db upgrade    # Reapply
   ```

8. **Quick verification:**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/check-migration-heads.sh
   ```
