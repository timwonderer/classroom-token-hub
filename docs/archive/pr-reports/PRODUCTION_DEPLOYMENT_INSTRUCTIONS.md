# Production Deployment Instructions

**Branch:** `claude/evaluate-insurance-overhaul-019oGphUSg12cNwcSiwgeqzP`
**Feature:** Insurance Claim Processing System with Security Fixes
**Status:** Ready for final validation and deployment

---

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step instructions for the three critical tasks required before deploying the insurance claim processing system to production:

1. **Code Review** - Second developer review of security fixes
2. **Regression Testing** - Full test suite execution on staging
3. **Database Migration** - Apply schema changes safely

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours total

---

## Task 1: Code Review (30-45 minutes)

### Objective
Have a second developer review all security-critical code changes to validate correctness and identify any potential issues.

### Instructions

#### 1.1 Checkout the Branch
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout claude/evaluate-insurance-overhaul-019oGphUSg12cNwcSiwgeqzP
git pull origin claude/evaluate-insurance-overhaul-019oGphUSg12cNwcSiwgeqzP
```

#### 1.2 Review Security Audit Documentation
Read these documents in order to understand the vulnerabilities and fixes:

1. **`SECURITY_AUDIT_INSURANCE_OVERHAUL.md`** (795 lines)
   - Understand all 5 security issues identified
   - Focus on P0-1, P0-2, P0-3, and P1-1 (the critical ones)
   - Review attack scenarios and financial impact

2. **`SECURITY_FIXES_CONSOLIDATED.md`** (392 lines)
   - Review implementation details for each fix
   - Verify defense-in-depth approach makes sense

#### 1.3 Review Critical Code Changes

Review these specific files and line ranges:

**File 1: `app/models.py`** (lines 512-517)
```bash
# Check unique constraint implementation
git show 261ec98:app/models.py | sed -n '512,517p'
```

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Unique constraint correctly targets `transaction_id` column
- [ ] Constraint name is descriptive: `uq_insurance_claims_transaction_id`
- [ ] No conflicts with existing constraints

---

**File 2: `app/routes/student.py`** (lines 1081-1150)
```bash
# Check race condition prevention
git diff 584ac5f..261ec98 -- app/routes/student.py
```

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Row-level locking uses `with_for_update()` correctly
- [ ] SQLite compatibility check is present (SQLite doesn't support FOR UPDATE)
- [ ] IntegrityError exception handling is correct
- [ ] User-friendly error messages are shown
- [ ] SQLAlchemyError is caught as fallback
- [ ] All database sessions are rolled back on error
- [ ] Logic flow prevents duplicate claims in all cases

**Key Questions:**
1. Does the locking prevent race conditions between concurrent requests?
2. Is the SQLite fallback acceptable for development/testing?
3. Are there any edge cases where duplicate claims could still occur?

---

**File 3: `app/routes/admin.py`** (lines 1770-1784) - P0-2 and P0-3 Fixes
```bash
# Check void transaction and ownership validation
git diff 584ac5f..b7706d7 -- app/routes/admin.py | grep -A 20 "P0-3"
```

**Review Checklist:**

*P0-2 Void Transaction Check:*
- [ ] Validation runs before claim approval
- [ ] Checks both claim type AND transaction existence AND void status
- [ ] Error message is clear to admin
- [ ] Validation prevents approval (not just warning)

*P0-3 Ownership Validation:*
- [ ] Compares `claim.transaction.student_id` with `claim.student_id`
- [ ] Security alert is logged to application logs
- [ ] Error message includes diagnostic info (student IDs)
- [ ] Validation blocks approval completely
- [ ] No race condition between check and approval

**Key Questions:**
1. Can an attacker bypass ownership check by manipulating the claim object?
2. Is logging sufficient for security audit trail?
3. Should there be additional alerts (email, Slack) for ownership mismatches?

---

**File 4: `app/routes/admin.py`** (lines 3289-3305) - P1-1 SQL Injection Fix
```bash
# Check SQL injection prevention
git diff 261ec98..b7706d7 -- app/routes/admin.py | grep -B 5 -A 15 "P1-1"
```

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] User input is validated with `datetime.strptime()`
- [ ] Date format is strict: `%Y-%m-%d`
- [ ] ValueError exception is caught
- [ ] User gets helpful error message about format
- [ ] Date arithmetic is done in Python (not SQL)
- [ ] `timedelta(days=1)` correctly adds one day
- [ ] SQLAlchemy properly parameterizes the Python datetime object
- [ ] No text() function is used with user input
- [ ] Both start_date and end_date are validated the same way

**Key Questions:**
1. Are there any other input vectors for SQL injection in this function?
2. Is the date format validation sufficient?
3. Could timezone issues cause incorrect filtering?

---

**File 5: Database Migration**
```bash
# Review migration file
find migrations/versions -name "*enforce_unique_claim_transaction*" -exec cat {} \;
```

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Migration adds constraint on correct table (`insurance_claims`)
- [ ] Migration adds constraint on correct column (`transaction_id`)
- [ ] Constraint name matches model: `uq_insurance_claims_transaction_id`
- [ ] Downgrade function properly removes constraint
- [ ] Migration handles existing data correctly
- [ ] No data loss occurs during migration

**Key Questions:**
1. What happens if existing data has duplicate `transaction_id` values?
2. Should we add a data cleanup step before applying constraint?
3. Is the downgrade safe to run if needed?

---

#### 1.4 Security Logic Validation

**Validate Defense-in-Depth for P0-1:**

The duplicate claim prevention has 3 layers. Verify all work together:

```
Layer 1 (Database): Unique constraint physically prevents duplicates
Layer 2 (Application): Row locking prevents race conditions
Layer 3 (Exception): IntegrityError caught and handled gracefully
```

**Test mentally:**
- [ ] If constraint fails, does app crash? (No - IntegrityError caught)
- [ ] If locking disabled on SQLite, is there still protection? (Yes - constraint)
- [ ] If two requests come simultaneously, which wins? (First to commit)
- [ ] Can user retry after seeing error? (Yes - redirect to form)

---

**Validate Business Logic for P0-3:**

The ownership check should prevent this attack:
```
1. Student A (ID=1) files claim for transaction T1 (student_id=1) 
2. Attacker changes claim.transaction_id to T2 (student_id=2)
3. Admin approves claim
4. Expected: BLOCKED with security alert 
5. Actual: Does the code do this?
```

**Verify in code:**
- [ ] Check happens BEFORE approval decision
- [ ] Check compares correct fields
- [ ] Check logs to current_app.logger
- [ ] Check adds to validation_errors list
- [ ] Approval is blocked if validation_errors is non-empty

---

#### 1.5 Code Quality Review

**General Code Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] No code duplication introduced
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Security logging is appropriate (not too verbose, not too quiet)
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs (student names, amounts OK; passwords NO)
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Variable names are clear
- [ ] Comments explain "why" not "what"
- [ ] No debugging code left in (print statements, commented code)

---

## Task 3: Database Migration (15-30 minutes)

### Objective
Safely apply the database schema changes to add the unique constraint on insurance claims.

### Migration File
`migrations/versions/a3b4c5d6e7f8_enforce_unique_claim_transaction.py`

---

### Instructions

#### 3.1 Pre-Migration Checks

**Check for Duplicate Data:**

Before applying the unique constraint, verify no existing duplicates exist:

```sql
-- Connect to staging database
psql classroom_economy_staging

-- Check for duplicate transaction_id values
SELECT
    transaction_id,
    COUNT(*) as claim_count,
    array_agg(id) as claim_ids
FROM insurance_claims
WHERE transaction_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY transaction_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY claim_count DESC;
```

**If duplicates found:**

```sql
-- Investigate the duplicates
SELECT
    ic.id as claim_id,
    ic.student_id,
    ic.transaction_id,
    ic.status,
    ic.created_at,
    t.amount,
    t.description
FROM insurance_claims ic
JOIN transactions t ON ic.transaction_id = t.id
WHERE ic.transaction_id IN (
    SELECT transaction_id
    FROM insurance_claims
    WHERE transaction_id IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY transaction_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
ORDER BY ic.transaction_id, ic.created_at;
```

**Resolution options if duplicates exist:**

1. **Keep oldest claim, delete newer ones:**
   ```sql
   -- For each duplicate transaction_id, keep only the first claim
   DELETE FROM insurance_claims
   WHERE id IN (
       SELECT ic2.id
       FROM insurance_claims ic1
       JOIN insurance_claims ic2 ON ic1.transaction_id = ic2.transaction_id
       WHERE ic1.id < ic2.id
       AND ic1.transaction_id IS NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. **Keep approved/paid claims, delete pending:**
   ```sql
   -- Prioritize claims by status
   DELETE FROM insurance_claims
   WHERE id IN (
       SELECT ic.id
       FROM insurance_claims ic
       WHERE EXISTS (
           SELECT 1 FROM insurance_claims ic2
           WHERE ic2.transaction_id = ic.transaction_id
           AND ic2.status IN ('approved', 'paid')
           AND ic.status = 'pending'
           AND ic2.id != ic.id
       )
   );
   ```

3. **Manual review:**
   - Export duplicates to CSV
   - Have admin review and decide which to keep
   - Manually delete unwanted claims

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Query run to check for duplicates
- [ ] If duplicates found, resolution plan decided
- [ ] Duplicates cleaned up before migration
- [ ] Verification query shows no duplicates remain

---

#### 3.2 Backup Database

**Create full backup before migration:**

```bash
# PostgreSQL
pg_dump classroom_economy_staging > backup_pre_migration_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup file created and has content
ls -lh backup_pre_migration_*.sql
head -20 backup_pre_migration_*.sql

# Test backup integrity
pg_restore --list backup_pre_migration_*.sql > /dev/null && echo "Backup OK"
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Backup created
- [ ] Backup file size > 0 bytes
- [ ] Backup file contains SQL content
- [ ] Backup includes insurance_claims table
- [ ] Backup location documented for rollback

---

#### 3.3 Run Migration on Staging

**Check current migration status:**

```bash
# Check current version
flask db current

# Check pending migrations
flask db history | head -20
```

**Apply migration:**

```bash
# Dry run (show SQL without executing)
flask db upgrade --sql > migration_sql.txt
cat migration_sql.txt

# Review the SQL to be executed:
# Should contain: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX or ADD CONSTRAINT
```

**Expected SQL:**
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE CONSTRAINT uq_insurance_claims_transaction_id
ON insurance_claims (transaction_id);
```

**Execute migration:**

```bash
# Run the migration
flask db upgrade

# Expected output:
# INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 2f3g4h5i6j7k -> a3b4c5d6e7f8, enforce unique claim transaction
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Migration SQL reviewed
- [ ] SQL contains constraint creation
- [ ] Migration executed successfully
- [ ] No error messages in output

---

#### 3.4 Verify Migration Success

**Check constraint exists:**

```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Check constraint
SELECT conname, contype, conrelid::regclass AS table_name
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conname = 'uq_insurance_claims_transaction_id';

-- Expected output:
--           conname                    | contype | table_name
-- -------------------------------------+---------+-----------------
--  uq_insurance_claims_transaction_id | u       | insurance_claims
```

**Test constraint enforcement:**

```sql
-- Try to insert duplicate (should fail)
BEGIN;

-- Insert first claim (should succeed)
INSERT INTO insurance_claims (
    student_insurance_id, policy_id, student_id, amount_requested,
    description, status, transaction_id, created_at
) VALUES (
    1, 1, 1, 100.00, 'Test claim 1', 'pending', 999999, NOW()
);

-- Try to insert duplicate (should fail)
INSERT INTO insurance_claims (
    student_insurance_id, policy_id, student_id, amount_requested,
    description, status, transaction_id, created_at
) VALUES (
    1, 1, 1, 100.00, 'Test claim 2 - DUPLICATE', 'pending', 999999, NOW()
);
-- Expected: ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint

ROLLBACK;  -- Clean up test data
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Constraint exists in database
- [ ] Constraint is type 'u' (unique)
- [ ] Constraint targets correct column
- [ ] Test insert of duplicate fails as expected
- [ ] Error message mentions constraint name

---

#### 3.5 Test Application After Migration

**Restart application:**

```bash
# Restart to load new schema
sudo systemctl restart classroom-economy
# OR
sudo supervisorctl restart classroom-economy

# Check application started successfully
sudo systemctl status classroom-economy
# OR
sudo supervisorctl status classroom-economy
```

**Basic smoke tests:**

```bash
# Test 1: Application responds
curl -I http://staging-server/ | head -1
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK or 302 redirect

# Test 2: Database connection works
curl http://staging-server/admin/login | grep -c "login"
# Expected: > 0 (login page loads)

# Test 3: Insurance pages load
# Login as admin, navigate to Insurance section
# Verify pages load without errors
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Application restarted successfully

#### 3.6 Migration Rollback Plan (In Case of Issues)

**If migration causes problems, rollback:**

```bash
# Step 1: Downgrade database
flask db downgrade -1

# Step 2: Verify constraint removed
psql classroom_economy_staging -c "
    SELECT conname
    FROM pg_constraint
    WHERE conname = 'uq_insurance_claims_transaction_id';
"
# Expected: 0 rows (constraint removed)

# Step 3: Restart application
sudo systemctl restart classroom-economy

# Step 4: Restore from backup if needed
psql classroom_economy_staging < backup_pre_migration_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql
```

**When to rollback:**
- Migration fails with error
- Application won't start after migration
- Constraint causes unexpected errors
- Data inconsistency detected

## Production Deployment (After All Tasks Complete)

Once all three tasks are successfully completed and approved:

### 1. Schedule Production Deployment

**Recommended Timing:**
- Low-traffic period (evening or weekend)
- Have rollback window available (2-3 hours)
- Developer on-call for monitoring

### 2. Production Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Backup production database
pg_dump classroom_economy_prod > backup_prod_pre_security_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# 2. Enable maintenance mode (if available)
touch /var/www/classroom-economy/maintenance_mode

# 3. Deploy code
git fetch origin
git checkout claude/evaluate-insurance-overhaul-019oGphUSg12cNwcSiwgeqzP
git pull origin claude/evaluate-insurance-overhaul-019oGphUSg12cNwcSiwgeqzP

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Run migration
flask db upgrade

# 6. Restart application
sudo systemctl restart classroom-economy

# 7. Verify deployment
curl -I https://production-url/

# 8. Run smoke tests
curl https://production-url/admin/insurance
curl https://production-url/student/insurance

# 9. Disable maintenance mode
rm /var/www/classroom-economy/maintenance_mode

# 10. Monitor logs
tail -f /var/log/classroom-economy/app.log
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

**Monitor for:**
- [ ] Application errors (500 errors)
- [ ] Security log alerts (ownership mismatch)
- [ ] IntegrityError exceptions (duplicate attempts)
- [ ] Slow query performance
- [ ] User-reported issues

**Success Metrics:**
- Zero 500 errors
- Duplicate claim attempts blocked successfully
- No void transaction approvals
- No ownership mismatch approvals
- No SQL injection attempts successful
