## Overview

We're pleased to announce the first stable release of **Classroom Token Hub**, an educational banking simulation platform designed to teach students financial literacy through hands-on classroom experience. Version 1.0 represents a significant milestone in the project's evolution, delivering a secure, feature-complete system ready for production classroom use.

Classroom Token Hub enables teachers to create simulated classroom economies where students earn tokens through attendance, manage checking and savings accounts, purchase items from a classroom store, and interact with financial products like insurance and rent—all within a safe, educational environment.

## Critical Fixes

### P0: Same-Teacher Multi-Period Data Leak (Fixed 2025-11-29)

**Issue:** Students enrolled in multiple periods with the same teacher were seeing aggregated data across all periods instead of period-specific information.

**Resolution:** Implemented join-code-based scoping across all transaction and financial tables. The system now uses `join_code` as the absolute source of truth for class isolation, ensuring proper data boundaries between different class periods.

**Migration:** Interactive backfill process guides administrators through associating legacy transactions with the correct class period. New transactions automatically inherit the correct join code.

**Status:** Deployed to production with ongoing backfill validation.

### P1: Deprecated Code Patterns (Completed 2025-12-06)

**Updated for Python 3.12+ and SQLAlchemy 2.0+ compatibility:**
- Replaced all 52 occurrences of deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
- Migrated all `Query.get()` calls to modern `db.session.get(Model, id)` pattern
- Resolved SQLAlchemy subquery coercion warnings

**Result:** Full compatibility with current Python and SQLAlchemy standards.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis (for production deployments)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/classroom-economy.git
   cd classroom-economy
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file with required configuration:
   ```bash
   SECRET_KEY=<long-random-string>
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
   FLASK_ENV=production
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte-base64-key>  # Generate: openssl rand -base64 32
   PEPPER_KEY=<secret-pepper-string>
   CSRF_SECRET_KEY=<random-string>
   ```

4. **Initialize the database:**
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # Development
   flask run

   # Production (with Gunicorn)
   gunicorn -c gunicorn_config.py wsgi:app
   ```

For detailed deployment instructions, see [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Upgrade Instructions

If upgrading from a pre-1.0 version:

1. **Backup your database** before proceeding
2. Pull the latest code and activate your virtual environment
3. Update dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run migrations: `flask db upgrade`
5. **Interactive backfill:** If you have legacy transactions without join codes, administrators will be prompted during normal operation to verify which class period those transactions belong to
6. Review the [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for breaking changes

---

## Known Limitations

- **Backfill in progress:** Legacy transactions created before the v1.0 join-code scoping update require interactive verification. Administrators will see occasional prompts to confirm which class period historical transactions belong to.
- **Browser compatibility:** Optimized for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Internet Explorer is not supported.
- **Mobile experience:** Basic responsive design implemented. Full mobile optimization planned for v1.2.

---

## What's Next

Development continues with planned features for future releases:

**v1.1 - Analytics & Insights**
- Enhanced dashboard visualizations
- Class economy health metrics
- CSV export capabilities for reports

**v1.2 - Mobile Experience**
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support
- Improved touch interfaces
- Offline attendance tracking

**v1.5+ - Extended Features**
- In-app communication and announcements
- Jobs feature (classroom job market)
- Custom condition builder for advanced rules
- Parent portal (optional, privacy-controlled)

See [../../development/DEVELOPMENT.md](../../development/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the complete roadmap.
