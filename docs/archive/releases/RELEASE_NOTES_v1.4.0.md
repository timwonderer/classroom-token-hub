##  Security Enhancements

### CodeQL Security Alerts Remediation

Comprehensively addressed 62 security alerts identified by CodeQL scanning (#737):

**Clear-text Logging of Sensitive Information**
- Removed TOTP secret printing from `scripts/create_admin.py`
- Removed TOTP secret printing from `wsgi.py` CLI command
- Removed TOTP secrets from seed script output
- TOTP secrets now encrypted in database with secure access only
- Prevents TOTP secrets from appearing in logs, console output, or command history

**DOM XSS Vulnerabilities**
- Fixed unsafe `innerHTML` usage in `templates/student_transfer.html`
- Fixed unsafe `innerHTML` usage in `static/js/attendance.js`
- Replaced with safe DOM manipulation using `createElement` and `textContent`
- Prevents XSS attacks via user-controlled data

**GitHub Actions Workflow Permissions**
- Added explicit permissions to `toggle-maintenance.yml`
- Added explicit permissions to `check-migrations.yml`
- Added explicit permissions to `deploy.yml`
- Follows principle of least privilege for workflow security
- Reduces workflow attack surface

**Summary**
- Fixed: 23+ real security issues
- Suppressed: 2 false positives in test files
- Reviewed: 37 false positives (already mitigated)
- All 62 alerts addressed appropriately

**Documentation**
- Added `../../security/SECURITY_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` with complete analysis of all alerts
- Documents remaining alerts as false positives with justification

### Enhanced Open Redirect Protection

Fixed critical URL redirection vulnerabilities in student class enrollment flow:

**What Was Fixed**
- Upgraded `_is_safe_url()` function to use same-origin validation
- Now uses `urljoin()` to resolve relative URLs against application's base URL
- Validates that redirect targets match the application's scheme and domain
- Prevents protocol-relative URLs and external redirects
- Added explicit security annotations (`# nosec`) with justification at all redirect points

**Impact**
- Addresses all 9 CodeQL security scanner findings for URL redirection vulnerabilities
- Affects student add-class flow redirect handling (`app/routes/student.py:710-877`)
- Prevents attackers from using the application as an open redirector

### Grafana Access Fix

Resolved "connection refused" error when accessing Grafana from system admin dashboard:

**Root Cause**
- Nginx `proxy_pass` had trailing slash that stripped URL path, causing infinite redirects

**Dual-Layer Solution**

**Flask Proxy (Fallback)**
- Added `/sysadmin/grafana` route that proxies to Grafana service
- Works immediately without Nginx configuration changes
- Maintains system admin authentication via `@system_admin_required`
- Configurable via `GRAFANA_URL` environment variable (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`)
- Rate-limit exempt for smooth dashboard operation
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Initially added `requests==2.32.3` dependency, which was later updated (see Dependency Updates section).

**Nginx Fix (Production)**
- Corrected configuration provided in `deploy/nginx/nginx-grafana-fix.conf`
- Remove trailing slash from `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000/` → `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Nginx intercepts requests before Flask (faster performance)
- Auto-fallback to Flask proxy if Nginx not configured

**Documentation**
- See `../../operations/GRAFANA_FIX_GUIDE.md` for detailed implementation guide

##  Bug Fixes

### Teacher Invite Code Validation

Fixed critical bugs preventing teacher signup with invite codes (#738):

**Whitespace Handling**
- Strip whitespace from invite codes during creation and validation
- Prevents copy-paste errors where whitespace causes "invalid invite code" errors
- Ensures consistency between code creation (system admin/CLI) and validation (signup)
- Added cleanup script (`../../scripts/cleanup_invite_codes.py`) for existing codes with whitespace

**Timezone Comparison Error**
- Fixed TypeError when comparing invite code expiration dates
- Database stores datetimes as timezone-naive (UTC)
- Comparison was using timezone-aware datetime.now(timezone.utc)
- Added conversion to make database datetime timezone-aware before comparison
- Fixes: TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes

**TOTP Form Validation**
- Properly handle TOTP confirmation form submission separate from initial signup form
- Use AdminTOTPConfirmForm for TOTP submissions instead of AdminSignupForm
- Populate form data fields before rendering for proper WTForms validation
- Pass date string (YYYY-MM-DD) instead of integer for dob_sum field in TOTP confirmation
- Fixes: "dob_sum field is required" error when submitting TOTP code

**Debug Logging**
- Added comprehensive logging for invite code creation and validation
- Log TOTP code receipt, length, and verification result
- Log form validation errors and submission details
- Helps diagnose signup issues quickly

### TOTP Setup UI

Updated TOTP setup page to match new brand theme:

**Theme Consistency**
- Replaced hardcoded colors with CSS variables (--primary, --secondary, etc.)
- Updated gradient to use var(--primary) and var(--primary-hover)
- Changed logo from teacher-logo-192.png to logo_teacher_transparent_512.png
- Updated QR panel and manual code styling to use theme variables
- Added pattern background to branding side to match signup page
- Updated button hover states to match new brand guidelines

### Onboarding Templates

- Updated color scheme and text for better consistency with new brand theme
- Improved visual consistency across all onboarding flows

### Admin Dashboard
- Fixed duplicate greeting that was appearing in both page header and content section
- Now shows single, centered greeting for cleaner appearance

### Student Dashboard
- Improved account balance cards with clearer styling
- Using light backgrounds instead of semi-transparent overlays for better readability
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness with proper Bootstrap column classes (col-12 col-md-6)
