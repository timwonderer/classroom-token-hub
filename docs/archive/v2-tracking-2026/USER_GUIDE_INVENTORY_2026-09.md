# User Guide Inventory — Phase 1

**Status:** Phase 1 complete
**Date:** 2026-09-04
**Scope:** User-facing help served by the in-app `/docs` site (`app/routes/docs.py`). Developer namespace docs (`INV-*`, `DOM-*`, `FEAT-*`, `ARC-*`, `SOP-*`) are out of scope — those ship separately via Docusaurus on GitHub Pages.

---

## What Phase 1 Did

Commit `da40d77d` moved the user guides to `docs/archive/v1-user-guides/` but left every consumer pointing at `user-guides/…`. The in-app docs site had been serving 404s for its entire user-facing section ever since.

Phase 1 restored the canonical location and repaired the reference graph:

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Promoted guides out of archive | `docs/archive/v1-user-guides/` → `docs/user-guides/` (100 files) |
| Repaired docs-site nav | ~40 `doc_path` links in `templates/docs/index.html` now resolve |
| Repaired contextual help | `help_doc_map` in `layout_admin.html` (44 entries) and `layout_student.html` (12 entries) now resolve |
| Fixed never-valid deep links | `admin_payroll.html`, `admin_store.html` pointed at `features/payroll/running-payroll` and `features/store/creating-items`, which never existed |
| Fixed search audience filter | `app/routes/docs.py` keyed the `user` audience off the literal `v1-user-guides` path segment; now keys off the `user-guides` top-level directory |
| Fixed 25 frontmatter refs | Legacy flat naming (`diagnostics/student-money`) never updated when files were nested (`diagnostics/student/money`) |
| Fixed 1 orphan | Teacher bills index linked the *student* insurance-claims guide instead of its own |
| Removed dev-doc leak | `economy_guide.md` linked into the developer domain namespace, which SOP-DOC-000 §User-Facing Separation forbids |

**Post-move integrity:** 0 broken relative links, 0 broken `related:` refs, 100/100 pages reachable from a nav entry point.

## Corpus Summary

100 markdown files, ~3,900 lines.

| Section | Files | Audience |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Root guides | 5 | mixed |
| Diagnostics | 22 | student (8), teacher (11), index (3) |
| Feature guides — student | 24 | student |
| Feature guides — teacher | 39 | teacher |
| Feature guides — sysadmin | 5 | sysadmin |
| Legal | 5 | public |

### Metadata health

| Field | Missing |
|-------|---------|
| Frontmatter block | 1 (`README.md` — acceptable, it is a directory index) |
| `title` | 0 |
| `description` | 25 |
| `roles` | 8 |

`description` feeds search result context and `roles` feeds UI role-highlighting in `docs/view.html`. Both gaps degrade the experience rather than break it. Fold the fixes into the Phase 3 rewrite rather than doing a separate pass.

### Depth distribution

Most pages are 25–40 lines — a task-shaped page with Overview, Step-by-Step, and Related. Two outliers carry real analytical depth and are the most valuable content in the corpus:

- `diagnostics/teacher/rent-itemization.md` — 476 lines
- `diagnostics/teacher/analytics.md` — 384 lines

Neither is linked from the docs index nav; both are reachable only via `diagnostics/teacher.md`. Worth promoting in Phase 5.

## Carried Into Phase 2

1. **Content is v1-shaped.** Every page describes v1 UI, navigation, and terminology. Accuracy against the current v2 app is unverified — that verification is Phase 2's job.
2. **Coverage is unknown.** 100 guides exist; whether they cover the v2 app's actual feature and template surface is exactly the Phase 2 question.
3. **Two known-stale areas.** `features/teacher/economy/policy-mode-rebalancer.md` and the rent itemization guides describe mechanics that have moved under the FEAT layer since v1.
4. **Sysadmin coverage is thin.** 5 pages against a substantial sysadmin surface (`templates/system_admin_*.html`, `sysadmin_*.html`).

---

## Out of Scope

Developer namespace links in `templates/docs/index.html` remain broken and are intentionally left alone — they target `ARCHITECTURE/`, `FEATURES/`, and `STANDARD_OPERATING_PROCEDURES/` paths that moved during the v2 reorganization. Those belong to the Docusaurus/GitHub Pages developer site:

- `ARCHITECTURE/ARC-CORE-000_Architecture_Foundation`
- `ARCHITECTURE/OPERATIONS/ARC-OPS-005_Api_Reference`
- `ARCHITECTURE/OPERATIONS/ARC-OPS-007_Database_Schema`
- `FEATURES/ANALYTICS/FEAT-MET-001_Analytics_Specification`
- `STANDARD_OPERATING_PROCEDURES/DEPLOYMENT/SOP-DEP-006_Deployment_Guide`
- `STANDARD_OPERATING_PROCEDURES/SOP-DOC-001_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX`
