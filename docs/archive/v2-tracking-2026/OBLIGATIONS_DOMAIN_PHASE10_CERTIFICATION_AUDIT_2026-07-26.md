## Executive Summary

**Status: ❌ REJECTED (MANDATORY criteria failures — Branch is behind base branch)**

A full domain reconstruction QA audit has been performed on the `obligatin-domain-rewire` branch at commit `a73d96db` using the checklist structure defined in [SOP-DEV-002a_DOMAIN_RECONSTRUCTION_QA_AUDIT.md](file://docs/STANDARD_OPERATING_PROCEDURES/DEVOPS/SOP-DEV-002a_DOMAIN_RECONSTRUCTION_QA_AUDIT.md). 

All code, schema definitions, multi-tenancy enforcement, and unit tests have been audited. The obligations domain has been successfully reconstructed in accordance with DOM-OBL-001. All 9 obligations unit tests pass successfully. 

The audit is marked as **REJECTED** solely due to the git repository status: the branch is behind the base branch `origin/codex/v2.0` by 1 commit (`cc6e37fb` - redis dependency bump).

---

## Phase 0: Boundary

**Goal:** Domain scope is clearly defined and authorized.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] Domain specification document exists (DOM-* or INV-* authority)
- [x] Scope is explicitly generic (not tied to one obligation type, entity type, or feature)
- [x] Multi-tenancy model specified (class_id scoping for educational domains)

**GUIDANCE:**
- [x] Domain examples show scope applies to multiple entity types or obligation types

---

## Phase 1: Truth

**Goal:** Canonical facts are defined and immutable.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**

---

## Phase 2: Persistence

**Goal:** Database schema matches models; migrations are idempotent; indexes support queries.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] Migration files exist for all new tables
- [x] Migrations include idempotency helpers
- [x] Migration upgrade/downgrade tested successfully
- [x] Foreign key constraints present and enforced at database level
- [x] No hardcoded constraint names; constraints discovered dynamically via schema inspection

**GUIDANCE:**

## Phase 4: Mutation Boundary

**Goal:** All state changes go through FEAT layer; mutations are atomic and logged.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] All domain state mutations wrapped in FEATContext
- [x] Routes never directly call db.session.add/commit
- [x] FEAT implementations use idempotency_key for exactly-once semantics
- [x] Mutation events logged with correlation_id for audit trail
- [x] FEAT boundary enforced (test verifies direct mutation blocked)

**GUIDANCE:**
- [x] Transaction rollback tested on FEAT failure

---

## Phase 5: Read Models

**Goal:** View models are immutable, generic, and scoped; they hide persistence shape from consumers.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] View model dataclasses are frozen (immutable)
- [x] Constructor functions are generic
- [x] Derived state is computed at read time
- [x] All queries in view model constructors scoped by class_id
- [x] View models tested with unit tests covering happy path, edge cases, multi-tenancy

**GUIDANCE:**
- [x] View models include all fields necessary for display
- [x] Documentation explains what each view model answers

---

## Phase 6: Surface Inventory

**Goal:** Routes and templates consume view models; no legacy variables passed to templates.

- [x] No legacy aggregation variables in render_template context
- [x] Templates access view_model fields directly

---

## Phase 7: Rewire

**Goal:** Ad-hoc aggregation logic replaced with canonical builders; routes become thin request handlers.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] Manual entity queries moved to view model builders
- [x] Status/aggregation computation moved from routes to view models
- [x] No legacy helper functions imported in routes
- [x] Route logic delegates to view model; routes are thin handlers
- [x] GET handlers are pure (no db.session.commit or side effects)

**GUIDANCE:**
- [x] Route complexity reduced compared to legacy implementation

---

## Phase 8: Verify

**Goal:** Tests prove canonical model is correct and multi-tenant safe.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**

- [x] No regression in existing tests
- [x] Domain-specific operations tested

**GUIDANCE:**
- [x] Test coverage 80%+ for view model service

## Sign-Off Findings Details

### 1. Test Verification
All 9 unit/integration tests in `tests/dom/obligations/test_obligations_domain.py` passed successfully.

### 2. Multi-Tenancy Scoping
Confirmed that `class_id` has been successfully implemented on the `bill_cycles` model class and corresponding database column referencing `classes.class_id`, establishing complete schema-level multi-tenant isolation compliance.

### 3. FEAT Code Alignment
Confirmed that the `due_at` and `viewable_at` parameters have been correctly removed from the `ObligationAssessment` constructor calls inside `app/feats/assess_obligation_feat.py`, matching the clean v2.5 schema contract.

### 4. Git Alignment
The branch is behind `origin/codex/v2.0` by 1 commit:
- `cc6e37fb` - chore(deps): bump redis from 7.4.0 to 8.0.1 (#1255)
This is the single blocking issue preventing final approval.

## ADDENDUM — Certification Gap Surfaced 2026-08-16

**Status:** ⚠️ This 2026-07-26 certification is **retained with a known audit gap**. The domain remains in service; a re-audit is recommended after Scope B remediation (see follow-up doc).

**Trigger:** Every teacher-facing template touching the Obligations domain crashed on load with `werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError` referencing `admin.reverse_cycle_penalties` and `admin.remove_rent_waiver`.

**Root cause:** Two admin routes were intentionally deleted for FEAT-OBL-003 immutability compliance (commits `6c9c3857` on 2026-07-18 and `eeef3de7` on 2026-07-25), both **before** this Phase 10 certification. The Phase 10 audit did not perform a cross-layer reference check — no confirmation that surviving templates still resolved to living endpoints.

**Additional finding:** Deeper investigation exposed a `rent_settings` mutation-pattern violation of `DOM-POL-001 §VI` (in-place edits of what should be an append-only versioned row). This gap was not visible to the 2026-07-26 audit because `rent_settings` is Policies-domain territory that this audit did not co-review, and because the `DOM-CORE-001` / `DOM-CORE-002` ownership contradiction (since corrected) had misattributed `rent_settings` in a way that could have plausibly routed the concern to Obligations. The violation was pre-existing, not introduced.

**Emergency remediation (branch `fix/obligation-template-broken-urls`, merged into `feat/paste-staging-grid`):**

- Commit `053c20f4` — orphan UI removed from `templates/admin_rent_settings.html`.
- Commit `31be25a3` — dead schema columns `rent_settings.active_version_id` / `next_version_id` dropped by migration `2978fdba914a`.
- Playwright headless browser traversal of every obligation-owned teacher-facing route under canonical test context: all render 200, no `BuildError` / `jinja2.exceptions` / console errors.

**Not remediated in that branch:** the `rent_settings` mutation-pattern violation (Scope B). Requires model, route, scheduler, rebalancer, and migration changes. Documented in `docs/TRACKING/OBLIGATION_POLICIES_FOLLOWUP_2026-08-16.md` §III.

**Required for re-audit acceptance:**

1. Scope B remediation landed.
2. Cross-layer template sweep (Playwright or equivalent real-browser traversal) becomes a mandatory Phase 10 gate.
3. Joint sign-off with Policies domain (`DOM-POL-001`) on any table Obligations consumes.
