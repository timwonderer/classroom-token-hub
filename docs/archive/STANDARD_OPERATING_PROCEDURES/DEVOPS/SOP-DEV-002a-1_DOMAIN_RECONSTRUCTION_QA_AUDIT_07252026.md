# SOP-DEV-002-1: Domain Reconstruction QA Audit 07/25/2026

**Purpose:** Verification that a domain reconstruction follows all 10 SOP-DEV-002 phases and meets production readiness standards.

**Authority:** SOP-DEV-002, INV-CORE-000, INV-ARC-007, INV-ARC-016, INV-ARC-021, DOM-CORE-002

**Scope:** Any domain reconstruction project following SOP-DEV-002 pattern.

**Reference Example:** DOM-OBL-001 (Obligations Domain) illustrates how to apply these criteria to a concrete domain.

---

## Criterion Classification

**MANDATORY:** Every mandatory criterion traces to constitutional authority (INV-*, DOM-CORE-*, FEAT-*). Failures on mandatory criteria block sign-off.

**GUIDANCE:** Recommendations without explicit authority backing. Failures on guidance criteria are noted but do not block sign-off.

---

## Pre-Audit Checklist

### Repository State
- [x] All commits are on the feature branch (never on main)
- [ ] Branch is up-to-date with origin/codex/v2.0
- [ ] No uncommitted changes (`git status` is clean)
- [x] No merge conflicts

### Documentation
- [x] Memory file exists documenting the work
- [x] Certification audit document exists
- [x] Phase completion notes are clear and dated

---

## Phase 0: Boundary

**Goal:** Domain scope is clearly defined and authorized.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] Domain specification document exists (DOM-* or INV-* authority) — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 0*
- [x] Scope is explicitly generic (not tied to one obligation type, entity type, or feature) — *DOM-CORE-002: Domains must define scopes that generalize across variations*
- [x] Multi-tenancy model specified (class_id scoping for educational domains) — *INV-CORE-000: Multi-tenant isolation is foundational*

**GUIDANCE:**
- [x] Domain examples show scope applies to multiple entity types or obligation types

---

## Phase 1: Truth

**Goal:** Canonical facts are defined and immutable.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] Canonical fact table(s) exist for domain entities — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 1, INV-ARC-016: Lawful Existence and Audit Lineage*
- [x] Facts are immutable (no user-facing update columns; new facts append, don't mutate) — *INV-ARC-016, DOM-CORE-002: Facts are append-only*
- [x] Foreign keys link domain facts to authoritative sources in other domains — *INV-ARC-021: Cross-Domain Reference and Coordination*
- [x] Domain does not duplicate authoritative amounts/values from other domains (e.g., doesn't store Ledger amounts) — *INV-ARC-021*
- [ ] Multi-tenancy key (class_id or equivalent) present on all fact tables — *INV-CORE-000: Multi-tenant data isolation*
- [x] Timestamps (created_at or equivalent) on fact tables for audit lineage — *INV-ARC-016*

**Reference:** DOM-OBL-001 Section V-VI defines assessment_events, bill_cycles, and event_type (ASSESSMENT, PAYMENT, WAIVED) as immutable facts.

---

## Phase 2: Persistence

**Goal:** Database schema matches models; migrations are idempotent; indexes support queries.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] Migration files exist for all new tables — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 2*
- [x] Migrations include idempotency helpers (table_exists, column_exists, etc.) — *Standard practice for safe re-runnable migrations*
- [x] Migration upgrade/downgrade tested successfully — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 2*
- [x] Foreign key constraints present and enforced at database level — *INV-ARC-021*
- [x] No hardcoded constraint names; constraints discovered dynamically via schema inspection — *Standard practice to avoid naming collisions*

**GUIDANCE:**
- [x] Indexes created on query columns (foreign keys, tenant keys, filter columns)

**Reference:** DOM-OBL-001 Section VI specifies table structure for assessment_events and bill_cycles with foreign keys to seats, classes, and transactions.

---

## Phase 3: Primitives

**Goal:** Core domain queries centralized in service layer; all queries use ORM; multi-tenancy scoped.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] Core domain queries implemented in service layer functions — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 3*
- [x] All queries use SQLAlchemy ORM (no raw SQL in service layer) — *INV-CORE-000: Canonical architecture*
- [x] Every query that involves domain entities scoped by class_id (multi-tenancy enforcement) — *INV-CORE-000: Multi-tenant data isolation*
- [ ] Unit tests verify each primitive operation works correctly — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 3*
- [ ] Tests include multi-tenancy verification (no cross-class data leakage) — *INV-CORE-000*

**GUIDANCE:**
- [x] Service functions have docstrings explaining contracts

**Reference:** DOM-OBL-001 Section IX defines canonical business operations: `create_obligation()`, `satisfy_obligation()`, `advance_bill_cycle()`.

---

## Phase 4: Mutation Boundary

**Goal:** All state changes go through FEAT layer; mutations are atomic and logged.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] All domain state mutations wrapped in FEATContext (FEAT-* layer) — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 4, INV-ARC-009: Domain Authority for State*
- [x] Routes never directly call db.session.add/commit — *INV-ARC-009*
- [x] FEAT implementations use idempotency_key for exactly-once semantics — *DOM-CORE-002: Idempotency required*
- [x] Mutation events logged with correlation_id for audit trail — *INV-ARC-016: Lawful Existence and Audit Lineage*
- [x] FEAT boundary enforced (test verifies direct mutation blocked) — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 4*

**GUIDANCE:**
- [x] Transaction rollback tested on FEAT failure

---

## Phase 5: Read Models

**Goal:** View models are immutable, generic, and scoped; they hide persistence shape from consumers.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] View model dataclasses are frozen (immutable) — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 5*
- [x] Constructor functions are generic (parameterized, not hardcoded to one entity type) — *DOM-CORE-002*
- [x] Derived state is computed at read time (status, balances, counts) — *DOM-CORE-002: Derived state SHALL NOT be persisted*
- [x] All queries in view model constructors scoped by class_id — *INV-CORE-000*
- [ ] View models tested with unit tests covering happy path, edge cases, multi-tenancy — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 8: "Tests prove canonical model is correct and multi-tenant safe"*

**GUIDANCE:**
- [x] View models include all fields necessary for display
- [x] Documentation explains what each view model answers

**Reference:** DOM-OBL-001 Section X defines StudentObligationView and ClassObligationSummary as canonical view models with computed current_period, status_breakdown, and payment_history.

---

## Phase 6: Surface Inventory

**Goal:** Routes and templates consume view models; no legacy variables passed to templates.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] Routes call view model constructors — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 6*
- [x] Routes pass view_model object to template — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 6*
- [x] No legacy aggregation variables in render_template context — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 6*
- [x] Templates access view_model fields directly (not persistence objects) — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 6*

---

## Phase 7: Rewire

**Goal:** Ad-hoc aggregation logic replaced with canonical builders; routes become thin request handlers.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [x] Manual entity queries moved to view model builders — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 7*
- [x] Status/aggregation computation moved from routes to view models — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 7*
- [x] No legacy helper functions imported in routes — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 7/9*
- [x] Route logic delegates to view model; routes are thin handlers — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 7*
- [x] GET handlers are pure (no db.session.commit or side effects) — *INV-ARC-007*

**GUIDANCE:**
- [x] Route complexity reduced compared to legacy implementation

---

## Phase 8: Verify

**Goal:** Tests prove canonical model is correct and multi-tenant safe.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**
- [ ] View model tests exist and pass covering: happy path, edge cases, multi-tenancy — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 8*
- [ ] Multi-tenancy test verifies no cross-class data leakage — *INV-CORE-000*
- [ ] No regression in existing tests — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 8*
- [ ] Domain-specific operations tested (e.g., status derivation, payment application) — *SOP-DEV-002 Phase 8*

**GUIDANCE:**
- [x] Test coverage 80%+ for view model service
- [x] Edge cases explicitly tested (no data, empty entities, etc.)

---

## Phase 9: Legacy Deletion

**Goal:** Dead code removed; only canonical code remains.

### Sign-Off Criteria

**MANDATORY:**

## Sign-Off Statement

**QA Reviewer:** Antigravity AI

**Date:** 2026-07-25

**Status:** ❌ REJECTED (MANDATORY criteria failures)

**Mandatory Criteria Status:** All MANDATORY criteria must be met for approval. Failures on MANDATORY criteria block sign-off.

**Guidance Criteria Status:** GUIDANCE criteria are recommendations for code quality. Gaps in guidance do not block sign-off but should be tracked for follow-up work.

**Comments:**

```
1. Feature Branch Up-To-Date:
- The branch 'obligatin-domain-rewire' is behind the base branch 'origin/codex/v2.0' by 1 commit ('cc6e37fb').

2. Multi-Tenancy Scoping:
- The 'bill_cycles' fact table lacks a multi-tenancy key ('class_id' or equivalent), preventing it from being fully compliant with INV-CORE-000 multi-tenant data isolation at the schema level. While the table is specified as identity-blind in DOM-OBL-001, this introduces a structural data isolation discrepancy under Phase 1 requirements.

3. Test Execution Failures (Mandatory Criteria):
- Out of 9 tests in 'tests/dom/obligations/test_obligations_domain.py', 4 failed:
  - TestAssessObligation.test_create_assessment_creates_assessment_event
  - TestAssessObligation.test_assess_obligation_idempotent_by_lineage
  - TestSatisfyObligation.test_satisfy_obligation_creates_waived_event
  - TestSatisfyObligation.test_waiver_only_for_rent
- Root Cause:
  The 'assessment_events' table schema was correctly migrated to align with the DOM-OBL-001 v2.5 spec (dropping 'due_at' and 'viewable_at' columns). However, 'app/feats/assess_obligation_feat.py' was not updated. It still passes 'due_at' and 'viewable_at' arguments when constructing the 'ObligationAssessment' instance, resulting in:
  "TypeError: 'due_at' is an invalid keyword argument for ObligationAssessment".
- Because these mandatory test coverage items fail, this certification run is officially REJECTED.
```
