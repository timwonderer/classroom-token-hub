# Changelog

All notable changes to the Classroom Token Hub project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project follows semantic versioning principles.


## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Attendance Issue Reporting** - Students can now report issues with specific attendance/tap events (clock in/out records) directly from the Work & Pay page
  - New route `/help-support/tap-event/<id>/report` for reporting attendance record issues
  - Report buttons added to all tap event tables in Work & Pay > Attendance Record tab
  - Uses same issue resolution workflow as transaction reporting
  - Students can report up to 20 most recent tap events per block

### Fixed
- **Transaction Issue Reporting** - Added report buttons to all transaction tables in Banking/Finances page (Checking and Savings tabs), allowing students to report issues on any visible transaction (up to 50 most recent), not just the 5 shown on dashboard
- **Issue Resolution Display** - Fixed `developer_resolved` status showing as "Escalated" instead of "Resolved by Developer" in teacher view
- **Issue Context Snapshot** - Fixed incorrect balance calculation in context_snapshot by using Student model's `get_checking_balance()` and `get_savings_balance()` methods instead of non-existent `get_balances()` function
- **System Admin Announcements** - Fixed ValueError when creating announcements by adding custom coerce function to handle empty string in target_teacher field
- **Passkey Authentication** - Fixed missing username parameter in passkey authentication start request causing 500 error
- **Passkey Registration** - Fixed credential ID extraction from passwordless.dev SDK response by using correct destructuring pattern `{ token, error }`
- **Content Security Policy** - Added `https://static.cloudflareinsights.com` to `connect-src` directive to allow Cloudflare analytics
- **Content Security Policy** - Added `worker-src 'self' blob:` directive to allow Web Workers used by passwordless.dev library
- **Content Security Policy** - Added `'unsafe-eval'` to `script-src` directive to allow passwordless.dev library to function properly

    - View all submitted issues with status tracking
  - **Teacher Features**:
    - Issue review queue with pending/resolved/escalated tabs
    - Detailed issue view showing student explanation, context, and transaction details
    - Resolution actions:
      - Reverse/void transactions directly from issue interface

    - Default categories: 6 transaction types + 6 general issue types
    - Opaque student references for sysadmin privacy (non-reversible hashes)
    - Multi-tenancy scoping by `join_code` for proper class isolation
    - Context snapshots preserve ledger state at time of submission
    - Complete audit trail with timestamps and attribution
    - Immutable student submissions after creation

    - Evidence-based issue tracking (tied to concrete transactions/records)
    - Data minimization for sysadmin review
    - Status badges only (non-communicative design)
  - Routes:
    - Student: `/student/help-support`, `/student/help-support/submit-issue`, `/student/help-support/transaction/<id>/report`

  - Added `encrypt_totp()` and `decrypt_totp()` helper functions in `app/utils/encryption.py`
  - All new admin/system admin accounts store encrypted TOTP secrets (base64-encoded)
  - Backward compatible: `decrypt_totp()` handles both encrypted and legacy plaintext secrets transparently
  - **MIGRATION REQUIRED**: Column length expanded from VARCHAR(32) to VARCHAR(200) - See `security/MIGRATION_TOTP_ENCRYPTION.md`
  - Defense in depth: Database compromise alone no longer sufficient to generate valid 2FA codes
  - **Note:** Still requires `ENCRYPTION_KEY` security - future migration to AWS Secrets Manager/Vault recommended
  - Files changed: `app/utils/encryption.py`, `app/models.py`, `app/routes/admin.py`, `app/routes/system_admin.py`, `wsgi.py`, `scripts/create_admin.py`

  - Impact: Prevents accidental exposure of PII in development logs, log files, or screenshots
  - Note: Production deployments should configure `LOG_LEVEL=WARNING` or higher to minimize log output
- **CRITICAL: Fixed PromptPwnd AI Prompt Injection Vulnerability** - Disabled vulnerable `summary.yml` GitHub Actions workflow
  - Workflow used AI inference (`actions/ai-inference@v1`) with untrusted user input from issue titles/bodies
  - Attack vector: Any user could create an issue with malicious prompt injection to leak `GITHUB_TOKEN` or manipulate workflows
  - Remediation: Disabled workflow by renaming to `summary.yml.DISABLED`
  - Impact: No exploitation detected - vulnerability fixed proactively
  - Documentation: See `docs/security/PROMPTPWND_REMEDIATION.md` for full details
  - Reference: [Aikido Security PromptPwnd Disclosure](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/promptpwnd-ai-prompt-injection-in-github-actions) (December 2025)
- **Comprehensive Attack Surface Security Audit Completed** - Full security review of codebase, CI/CD, and infrastructure
  - Audited: GitHub Actions workflows, authentication, authorization, encryption, multi-tenancy, dependencies, and API security
  - Findings: 16 total findings (2 critical, 2 high, 3 medium, 4 low, 5 informational)
  - Critical issues: AI prompt injection (fixed), SSH host key verification disabled (open)
  - Strengths: Excellent CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention, XSS mitigation, PII encryption, multi-tenancy isolation
  - Recommendations: Enable SSH host key verification, update cryptography package, improve secrets management
  - Documentation: See `docs/security/COMPREHENSIVE_ATTACK_SURFACE_AUDIT_2025.md` for complete report

  - Recent purchases show student name, item, price, purchase time, and current status
  - Fixed markdown rendering issue in item descriptions (was showing raw "####" markdown syntax)
  - More useful for teachers to see what requires their attention rather than what's already in their store

### Fixed
- **Service Worker Cache Errors** - Fixed persistent browser console errors from Service Worker
  - Stopped caching `chrome-extension://` URLs (was causing repeated errors)
  - Stopped caching POST/PUT/DELETE requests (HTTP method not cacheable)
  - Removed non-existent `brand-logo.svg` from static assets cache list
  - Bumped cache version to v7 to force fresh cache on next page load
  - Created `shouldCache()` helper function to centralize cache eligibility logic
- **Passkey Registration ReferenceError** - Fixed JavaScript error preventing passkey registration
  - Variable was renamed from `credId` to `credentialId` but one reference wasn't updated

## [2025-11-25] - Maintenance & Bypass Enhancements

### Added
- Persistent maintenance mode across deploys (`deploy_updates.sh`) with `--end-maintenance` explicit exit flag
- System admin and token-based maintenance bypass with session persistence (`maintenance_global_bypass`)

- Badge icon/text server-side mapping and status description rendering fallback when JS disabled
- Documentation for maintenance variables and operational workflow (see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`)

### Changed
- `deploy_updates.sh` now detects existing maintenance state instead of resetting it
- Bypass logic promotes valid sysadmin/token to global session for teacher/student role testing
