# Security Audit Report - November 2025

**Date:** 2025-11-28
**Server:** classroom-economy-beta (DigitalOcean)
**Auditor:** Automated Security Review

## Executive Summary

Your server has **strong foundational security** with multiple layers of protection. The fail2ban system is actively protecting against brute-force attacks, and your multi-layered security approach (SSH hardening, firewall, Cloudflare proxy) provides solid defense-in-depth.

### Overall Security Score: 8.5/10 

**Strengths:**
- Infrastructure hardening is excellent
- Application-level security (PII encryption, RLS, CSRF) is robust
- Active intrusion prevention working correctly

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Missing HTTP security headers
- No application-level rate limiting
- Database security could be enhanced
- Automated security patching not configured

---

## 1. Infrastructure Security  STRONG

### 1.1 SSH Hardening  Excellent
**Configuration:** `scripts/secure-ssh-for-github-actions.sh`

-  Password authentication disabled
-  Key-based authentication only
-  Root login restricted to keys only (`prohibit-password`)
-  MaxAuthTries: 3 (strict)
-  Client timeout: 300 seconds
-  X11 Forwarding disabled

**Status:** Production-ready, no changes needed.

---

### 1.2 Fail2ban Protection  Working Correctly
**Current Status:**
```
Currently banned: 7 IPs
Total banned: 115 IPs
Total failed attempts: 498
Ban time: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
Find time: 10 minutes (600 seconds)
Max retries: 3 failed attempts
```

**Analysis:**
-  Actively blocking malicious IPs from various hosting providers
-  4.3 attempts per ban is normal (accounts for ban expiration and retries)
-  GitHub Actions deployments not affected
-  Configuration matches repository scripts

**Recommendation:** Consider increasing ban time for repeat offenders:
```bash
# Optional: Increase ban time to 24 hours for stricter protection
bantime = 86400  # 24 hours instead of 1 hour
```

---

### 1.3 DigitalOcean Firewall  Properly Configured
**Configuration:** `scripts/setup-firewall-complete.sh`

-  HTTP/HTTPS only from Cloudflare IPs (IPv4 + IPv6)
-  SSH restricted to specific IPs
-  All other ports blocked by default
-  Direct IP access blocked (origin protection)
-  UptimeRobot monitoring allowed

**Status:** Excellent defense-in-depth. Your server is only accessible through Cloudflare.

---

### 1.4 Cloudflare Proxy  Active
**Features:**
-  DDoS protection
-  Bot mitigation with Turnstile
-  Origin IP hidden
-  Request validation in app (`validate_cloudflare_request()`)
-  Real IP extraction from CF-Connecting-IP header

**Status:** Production-ready.

---

## 2. Application Security  GOOD (Some Improvements Needed)

### 2.1 Data Protection  Excellent

**PII Encryption:**
-  AES encryption at rest (Fernet) for student names
-  Separate encryption key (`ENCRYPTION_KEY`)
-  Peppered password hashing (`PEPPER_KEY`)
-  SQLAlchemy custom type decorators

**Database Security:**
-  PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
-  Multi-tenant data isolation
-  Automatic tenant context setting per request
-  Protection against horizontal privilege escalation

**Status:** Industry best practice implementation.

---

### 2.2 Authentication & Session Security  Strong

-  CSRF protection enabled (Flask-WTF)
-  Secure session cookies (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True`)
-  HttpOnly cookies (`SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True`)
-  SameSite=Lax (CSRF mitigation)
-  TOTP-based 2FA for system admins
-  No default passwords (TOTP-only)

**Status:** Meets security compliance standards.

---

### 2.3 Missing: HTTP Security Headers  **ACTION NEEDED**

**Currently Missing:**
-  Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
-  Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
-  X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection)
-  X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing protection)
-  Referrer-Policy
-  Permissions-Policy

**Impact:** Medium risk
- Vulnerable to clickjacking attacks
- No HTTPS enforcement at application level
- XSS attack surface not minimized

**Solution:** See recommendations section below.

---

### 2.4 Missing: Application-Level Rate Limiting 

**Currently Missing:**
-  No rate limiting on login endpoints
-  No API rate limiting
-  No brute-force protection beyond fail2ban

**Impact:** Low-Medium risk
- Fail2ban provides network-level protection
- Application could benefit from per-user rate limits

**Solution:** See recommendations section below.

---

## 3. Database Security  GOOD

**Strengths:**
-  Connection over localhost (not exposed)
-  Row-Level Security policies
-  PII encryption at rest
-  PostgreSQL parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy)

**Potential Improvements:**
-  Database credentials in `.env` file
-  No database connection encryption (not critical for localhost)
-  No automated backups documented

---

## 4. Dependency Security

**Current Setup:**
-  All major dependencies included in `requirements.txt`
-  Using maintained packages (Flask, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
-  No automated security updates
-  No dependency vulnerability scanning

**Recommendations:**
- Set up GitHub Dependabot for automated security updates
- Run `pip-audit` regularly to check for known vulnerabilities

---

## 5. Monitoring & Logging  Good

**Current Capabilities:**
-  Error logging to database (`ErrorLog` table)
-  Failed authentication tracking
-  Cloudflare request validation logging
-  Permission error tracking
-  404/500 error logging

**Potential Improvements:**
- Consider adding intrusion detection alerts
- Set up fail2ban notification emails

---

## 6. Security Recommendations (Priority Order)

### HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. Add HTTP Security Headers
**File:** `app/__init__.py`
**Implementation:** Add `@app.after_request` handler

```python
@app.after_request
def set_security_headers(response):
    """Add security headers to all responses."""
    # HTTPS enforcement (HSTS)
    response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'

    # Clickjacking protection
    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'SAMEORIGIN'

    # MIME sniffing protection
    response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'

    # XSS protection (legacy but still useful)
    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'

    # Referrer policy
    response.headers['Referrer-Policy'] = 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'

    # Content Security Policy (start restrictive, adjust as needed)
    response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = (
        "default-src 'self'; "
        "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://challenges.cloudflare.com; "
        "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://fonts.googleapis.com; "
        "font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; "
        "img-src 'self' data: https:; "
        "connect-src 'self' https://challenges.cloudflare.com; "
        "frame-src https://challenges.cloudflare.com;"
    )

    return response
```

#### 2. Enable GitHub Dependabot
**File:** `.github/dependabot.yml` (create new)

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    reviewers:
      - "timwonderer"
```

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 3. Add Application-Level Rate Limiting
**Package:** `Flask-Limiter`

```bash
pip install Flask-Limiter
```

```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(
    app=app,
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    default_limits=["200 per day", "50 per hour"],
    storage_uri="memory://"
)

# Apply to sensitive endpoints
@limiter.limit("5 per minute")
@app.route('/admin/login', methods=['POST'])
def admin_login():
    # ...
```

#### 4. Set Up Automated Backups
**Create:** `scripts/backup-database.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily PostgreSQL backup with rotation

BACKUP_DIR="/root/backups/postgresql"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"

mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup with compression
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" | gzip > "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$DATE.sql.gz"

# Keep only last 30 days
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "backup_*.sql.gz" -mtime +30 -delete

echo "Backup completed: backup_$DATE.sql.gz"
```

Add to crontab: `0 2 * * * /root/classroom-economy/scripts/backup-database.sh`

### LOW PRIORITY

#### 5. Increase Fail2ban Ban Time for Repeat Offenders
**File:** `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`

```ini
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = 22
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = 86400  # 24 hours instead of 1 hour
findtime = 600
```

#### 6. Add Security Monitoring Alerts
**Create:** Email notifications for fail2ban bans

```bash
# In /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
destemail = your-email@example.com
action = %(action_mwl)s
```

## Appendix: Quick Commands for Security Checks

```bash
# Check fail2ban status
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd

# View banned IPs
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd | grep "Banned IP"

# Check recent SSH attempts
sudo tail -100 /var/log/auth.log | grep "Failed password"

# Check if Cloudflare is the only HTTP/HTTPS source
sudo iptables -L -n -v | grep -E "80|443"

# Verify HTTPS certificate
curl -I https://yourdomain.com | grep -i "strict-transport"

# Check for security updates
apt list --upgradable 2>/dev/null | grep -i security
```
