## I. Purpose

This FEAT validates all recovery codes provided by students and restores teacher account access upon successful verification. Per DOM-IDEN-003 §IX:
> "Teacher enters all recovery codes collected from students."

The expected participants are the selected class representatives enrolled by
FEAT-IDEN-103, not all students on every roster.

This FEAT performs all-or-nothing validation: all recovery codes must be present and correct, or the entire recovery fails.

**Governing Authority:**
- DOM-IDEN-003 §IX (Teacher Recovery - All-or-Nothing Student Code Validation)
- DOM-IDEN-005 §VIII (Identity Binding)
- FEAT-CORE-000 (Feature Execution Constitutional Directive)

---

## II. Execution Context

### 1. Required Inputs

* `recovery_request_id`: The active recovery request from FEAT-IDEN-103.
* `user_id`: The teacher `User` recovering account (from context or recovery request).
* `submitted_codes`: Array of recovery codes provided by the teacher (from form/input).
  - Format: Array of strings, each code as typed/provided by student.
* `idempotency_key`: Client-provided unique request ID for retry safety.

### 2. Resolved Context (MANDATORY)

Before mutation, the FEAT MUST resolve:
* The `RecoveryRequest` record matching `recovery_request_id`.
* The `User` record matching `user_id`.
* Verify that `User.id == RecoveryRequest.user_id` (recovery is for this teacher).
* Resolve the selected seat/class participant set for this user-owned request. No single request-level class applies.

---

## III. Orchestration Logic

### A. Verification Phase (Read-Only)

#### Step 1: Check Idempotency (Replay Detection)
1. Query `IdempotencyRecord` where `idempotency_key = idempotency_key` and `feat_id = "FEAT-IDEN-105"`:
   - If found and `expires_at > NOW()` and recovery_request_id matches: Return `ALREADY_VERIFIED` (idempotent success, no re-execution).
   - If found but expired: Proceed with fresh execution.
   - If not found: Proceed to Step 2.

#### Step 2: Validate Recovery Request State
1. Query `recovery_requests` where `recovery_requests.id = recovery_request_id`.
2. Verify that `recovery_requests.status = 'pending'` (recovery is active and awaiting code validation).
3. Verify that `recovery_requests.expires_at > NOW()` (recovery request not expired).
4. Verify that `recovery_requests.user_id = user_id` (recovery belongs to this teacher).
5. **Failure Behavior**: Abort with `RECOVERY_NOT_ACTIVE` if recovery is closed or expired.

#### Step 2: Fetch the Selected Class Representatives
1. Read the selected `StudentRecoveryCode` seat/class rows provisioned at initiation.
2. Require one selected participant for each required class under the teacher User.
3. Read each selected participant's code hash; NULL is an unmet confirmation, not permission to shrink the quorum.
4. Do not substitute all students on the current rosters or invent request-level `eligible_seat_ids` / `eligible_seat_count` fields.

#### Step 3: Validate Code Coverage
Require one submitted code for each selected class representative. All selected
participants must have generated a code. Missing participants or codes fail the
entire submission generically; do not reveal which class or student failed.

#### Step 4: Verify Each Code
1. For each code in `submitted_codes`:
   - Hash the submitted code with `HASH_PASSWORD()` (same bcrypt + pepper).
   - Check if the hash matches any `student_recovery_codes.code_hash`.
   - Mark the code as verified.
2. If any code does not match, abort with `INVALID_CODE`.
   - **Security:** Use generic error message (do not disclose which code is wrong).
3. **Failure Behavior**: Return generic error without revealing which codes are correct/incorrect.

#### Step 5: Verify All Codes Accounted For
1. Ensure that ALL `student_recovery_codes` for this recovery request have been verified.
2. If any codes are missing, return `INCOMPLETE_SUBMISSION`.

#### Step 6: Check Expiration on Each Code
1. Verify that no code has expired (tied to recovery_request expiration).
2. **Failure Behavior**: Abort with `CODES_EXPIRED` if recovery request is past TTL.

---

### B. Mutation Phase (Atomic Transaction)

All mutations in this section **MUST** occur within a single database transaction.

#### Step 3: Mark Codes as Verified

Update all verified `student_recovery_codes`:
1. Set `verified_at = NOW()` (mark as verified/consumed - **authoritative one-time-use state**).
2. Do NOT modify `dismissed` field (dismissed is orthogonal to verified; a code can be dismissed without being used, or used without being dismissed).
3. **One-Time-Use Semantics**: A code with `verified_at IS NOT NULL` has been consumed and cannot be reused. A code with `verified_at IS NULL` has not been used (regardless of dismissed state).

#### Step 4: Update Recovery Request Status

Update the `recovery_requests` record:
1. Set `status = 'verified'` (recovery codes validated successfully).

Per DOM-IDEN-003 §IX:
> "`recovery_requests` status transitions: pending → verified"

#### Step 5: Store Idempotency Record

Create `IdempotencyRecord` atomically with this FEAT outcome:
1. `idempotency_key`: From request.
2. `feat_id`: "FEAT-IDEN-105".
3. `recovery_request_id`: The validated recovery request.
4. `outcome`: "CODES_VALIDATED" (successful validation).
5. `created_at`: Current UTC timestamp.
6. `expires_at`: UTC timestamp 24 hours in future.

**Purpose**: Prevents revalidation on retries with same idempotency_key.

#### Step 6: Audit Trace

Per FEAT-CORE-000 §III.4:

1. Call `DOM-OPS` to emit an `ACT-IDEN-105` audit event.
2. **Required fields**:
   - `feat_id`: "FEAT-IDEN-105"
   - `user_id`: The teacher `user_id`
   - `recovery_request_id`: The recovery request ID
   - `idempotency_key`: The provided key
   - `code_count`: Number of codes verified
   - `outcome`: `"RECOVERY_VERIFIED"` (only possible outcome)
   - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp

**Note:** DO NOT log any recovery codes or validation details.

#### Step 4: Trigger TOTP Reset Capability (Optional)

After successful verification:
1. Internally mark that this teacher can now reset TOTP via FEAT-IDEN-106.
2. Can be accomplished by:
   - Storing a temporary flag in the recovery request record, OR
   - Returning authorization token to the client (expires in 1 hour), OR
   - Directly invoking FEAT-IDEN-106 with recovery context.

**Note:** The actual TOTP reset happens in FEAT-IDEN-106 (separate FEAT).

## IV. Invariants & Constraints

### 1. All-or-Nothing Validation (MANDATORY)
Per DOM-IDEN-003 §IX:
> "ALL recovery codes must be provided and valid. A single missing or incorrect code fails the entire recovery."

This is not a majority-vote or threshold mechanism — all codes are required.

### 2. Active Recovery Required (MANDATORY)
Validation only proceeds if an active recovery request exists (`status = 'pending'` and `expires_at > NOW()`).

### 3. Expiration Tied to RecoveryRequest (MANDATORY)
If the recovery request expires, all associated codes expire. Validation fails if codes are expired.

### 4. One-Time Use (MANDATORY)
Each recovery code can be used only once. After successful validation, `student_recovery_codes.verified_at` is set to prevent re-use.

### 5. Atomic Transaction (MANDATORY)
All mutations SHALL occur in a single transaction. If any step fails, complete rollback occurs.

### 6. Generic Error Messages (MANDATORY)
Do not disclose:
- Which specific code is invalid
- How many codes are expected vs. provided (beyond count)
- Student identities or seat information

---

## V. Idempotency

**Mechanism:** The combination of `idempotency_key` and `recovery_request_id` acts as the idempotency lock.

**Behavior:**
- If a retry occurs with the same `idempotency_key`:
  - Check if `recovery_requests.status = 'verified'` (codes already validated).
  - If true, return success with outcome `ALREADY_VERIFIED` (no duplicate state).
  - If false, re-attempt the full validation.
- Replayed requests with the same `idempotency_key` **SHALL NOT** double-consume recovery codes.

**Client Responsibility:**
- Generate a stable `idempotency_key` (e.g., based on session).
- Retry on transient errors with the same key.
- Server stores key on audit log to detect and skip replays.

---

## VI. Failure Scenarios

When the FEAT fails, the system SHALL:

1. **Rollback all mutations** atomically.
2. **Emit audit event** with outcome `FAILED` and error code.
3. **Return error response** to client (generic message).
4. **NOT mark recovery as verified**.
5. **NOT consume recovery codes** (remain available for retry).

**Failure Cases:**

| Scenario | Error Code | HTTP Status | Message |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Recovery not active | `RECOVERY_NOT_ACTIVE` | 409 | "Recovery is not active. Please contact support." |
| Recovery expired | `RECOVERY_EXPIRED` | 410 | "Recovery request has expired. Please start a new recovery request." |
| Incomplete submission | `INCOMPLETE_SUBMISSION` | 400 | "You must provide all recovery codes. Check that you have one code per selected class representative." |
| Invalid code | `INVALID_CODE` | 400 | "One or more recovery codes are invalid. Please check and try again." |
| Codes expired | `CODES_EXPIRED` | 410 | "Recovery codes have expired. Please start a new recovery request." |
| Database error | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 | "An error occurred. Please try again." |

---

## VII. Audit Requirements

The `DOM-OPS` audit log **MUST** contain:

| Field | Type | Required | Rationale |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|
| `feat_id` | String | ✓ | Identifies the FEAT (always "FEAT-IDEN-105") |
| `user_id` | Integer | ✓ | The teacher user |
| `recovery_request_id` | Integer | ✓ | The recovery request being validated |
| `idempotency_key` | String | ✓ | Replay detection |
| `code_count` | Integer | ✓ | Number of codes verified |
| `outcome` | Enum | ✓ | Must be: `RECOVERY_VERIFIED` or `ALREADY_VERIFIED` |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 | ✓ | UTC timestamp of validation |
| `submitted_codes` | Array | ✗ | DO NOT log (security) |
| `error_code` | String | ⚠️ | Only if outcome is `FAILED` |

**Outcomes:**
- `RECOVERY_VERIFIED`: Successful validation of all recovery codes.
- `ALREADY_VERIFIED`: Idempotent return; recovery already verified.

---

## VIII. Display Requirements

After successful code validation, the route handler SHALL display to the teacher:

1. **Success Confirmation**: "Your identity has been verified!"
2. **Next Steps**: "You can now reset your TOTP authentication."
3. **Action Button**: "Reset TOTP" or "Set Up New Authentication"
   - Links to FEAT-IDEN-106 (Update TOTP Secret) or FEAT-IDEN-101 (fresh TOTP setup).

---

## IX. Integration with FEAT-IDEN-103, FEAT-IDEN-104, FEAT-IDEN-106

**Teacher recovery involves multiple coordinated FEATs:**

```
FEAT-IDEN-103: Teacher Initiates Recovery
└─ Creates recovery_request (status: pending)

FEAT-IDEN-104: Students Generate Recovery Codes
└─ Creates one student_recovery_code per student

FEAT-IDEN-105: Teacher Validates Recovery Codes (THIS FEAT)
├─ Teacher submits all recovery codes
├─ System validates all-or-nothing
└─ Marks recovery as verified

FEAT-IDEN-106: Update TOTP Secret (ENABLED AFTER RECOVERY)
├─ Teacher resets their TOTP authentication
└─ Generates new secret and backup codes
```

FEAT-IDEN-105 is the culmination of the recovery flow. After successful validation, the teacher has restored access and can reconfigure TOTP (FEAT-IDEN-106) or passkeys (similar FEAT).
