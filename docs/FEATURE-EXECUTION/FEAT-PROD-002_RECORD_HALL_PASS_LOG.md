# FEAT-PROD-002: Record Hall Pass Log

| Reference Number | Version | Effective Date | Supersedes | Authority Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FEAT-PROD-002 | 1.1 | 2026-10-01 | 1.0 | Normative |

*Revision 1.1 (2026-10-01; for owner ratification): adds §III.A, resolution of a pending hall-pass request (approve, reject, student cancel) held in `pending_actions` (DOM-STORE-001 5.3 §IX). §III is unchanged.*

---

## I. Purpose

This FEAT records approved hall-pass rows for the Productivity and Payroll domain.

It writes to `hall_pass_logs` and reads class-configuration-owned `hall_pass_settings` to determine whether the pass may be granted.

The row represents the approved hall-pass instruction and the entitlement-consumption event at the same time.

This FEAT uses `CanonicalContext` for live request authority and the canonical temporal resolver for request-time stamping.

---

## II. Execution Context

### 1. Required Inputs

- `ctx`: `CanonicalContext`
- `destination`: teacher-prescribed hall-pass destination
- `requested_by_seat_id`: seat requesting the pass
- `approved_by_seat_id`: seat approving the pass
- `reference_time_utc`: optional explicit timestamp for deterministic evaluation

### 2. Canonical Authority

- `ctx.class_id` provides the class boundary
- `ctx.seat_id` provides the approving seat for live teacher actions
- `ctx.actor_role` MUST be teacher or another lawful approving authority

The FEAT MUST not infer approval authority from the destination or hall-pass payload.

---

## III. Canonical Write

### `record_hall_pass_log(...)`

This is the only lawful mutation path for `hall_pass_logs`.

Typical use cases:

- teacher approves a hall pass request
- teacher issues a hall pass directly

Rules:

- MUST require `class_id`, `requested_by_seat_id`, `approved_by_seat_id`, and `destination`
- MUST evaluate class-scoped `hall_pass_settings` before writing the approved pass
- MUST NOT mutate `hall_pass_settings`; mutation of that table belongs to Class Configuration
- MUST fail closed if settings disable the requested destination
- MUST fail closed if queue or simultaneous limits are reached
- MUST record the request timestamp in class canonical time
- MUST represent approval and entitlement consumption together
- MUST set `hall_pass_logs.hall_pass_id` to the consumed entitlement instance `entitlement_id`
- MUST set `hall_pass_logs.correlation_id` to the consumed entitlement's source `correlation_id`
- MUST not record exit time
- MUST not record return time
- MUST not record hall-pass elapsed time
- MUST not derive attendance state from the hall-pass row

Execution steps:

1. Resolve `CanonicalContext` and confirm the approving actor is lawful for the class.
2. Resolve `CLE` with `canonical_temporal_resolver("CLE", primitive="current_time", canonical_execution_context=ctx, reference_time_utc=reference_time_utc)`.
3. Validate the requested seat, approving seat, and destination.
4. Read Class Configuration's `hall_pass_settings` for the class and evaluate pass-type enablement plus queue/simultaneous limits.
5. Consume one available entitlement instance through the entitlement service.
6. Record the approved hall-pass row in `hall_pass_logs` with the consumed entitlement's `entitlement_id` in `hall_pass_id` and its source `correlation_id`.
7. Return the approved hall-pass instruction as the lawful source for later attendance-session exit/return evidence.

Failure conditions:

- missing approval authority
- missing entitlement grant identity
- invalid class or seat boundary
- hall-pass settings prohibit the requested pass
- queue or simultaneous limits are reached
- attempt to backfill exit or return data into the hall-pass table

### III.A Resolving a pending hall-pass request

A pending hall-pass request is a `pending_actions` row with `authoritative_feat = FEAT-PROD-002` and payload kind `hall_pass_request`, submitted under `FEAT-STOR-002` §X.A. This FEAT is its only resolver (`DOM-STORE-001` §VII.B, §IX). Every resolution is scoped by `ctx.class_id`: a request in another class is not found.

**Approve** (teacher):

1. Lock the request row with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` and delete it. A concurrent resolution of the same request waits on that lock and, once this transaction commits, finds no row. Exactly one approval therefore succeeds; every other attempt fails as not found. The FEAT idempotency key is not relied on for this.
2. Record the pass through `record_hall_pass_log(...)` (§III) with the payload's `requested_by_seat_id` and `destination`, the approving seat from `ctx`, and the entitlement consumption §III requires.
3. Commit the deletion, the `hall_pass_logs` row and the pass consumption atomically.

If any step is refused (for example, no pass is available, or the settings prohibit the destination), the transaction rolls back and the request stays pending, unchanged, with its original `submitted_at` (`DOM-STORE-001` §VII.B: a failed resolution leaves the pending action intact).

**Reject** (teacher): lock and delete the row. Nothing else is written; no pass is consumed.

**Cancel** (student): lock and delete the row only when its `seat_id` is the student's own seat in `ctx`. Any other request is not found. Nothing else is written.

Reads of pending requests (teacher queue, dashboard, student status) take no lock and write nothing.

---

## IV. Temporal Rules

- Hall-pass request timestamps MUST be recorded in class canonical time.
- Exit and return timing remain attendance-session concerns and are not stored here.
- Any hall-pass display or comparison logic MUST use canonical temporal evaluation.

---

## V. Invariants

1. Hall-pass approval consumes entitlement.
2. `hall_pass_id` links the hall-pass log to the specific consumed entitlement instance.
3. The correlation ID links the hall-pass log to the entitlement source event.
4. If the pass was purchased from Store, the upstream ledger entry uses the same correlation ID.
5. The FEAT must fail closed if approval authority cannot be established.
6. `hall_pass_settings` is a Class Configuration-owned input to the PROD grant decision and must be evaluated before writing `hall_pass_logs`.
