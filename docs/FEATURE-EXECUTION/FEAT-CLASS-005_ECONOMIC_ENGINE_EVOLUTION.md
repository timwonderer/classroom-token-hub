# FEAT-CLASS-005: Economic Engine Evolution

| Reference Number | Version | Effective Date | Supersedes | Authority Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FEAT-CLASS-005 | 1.0 | 2026-08-09 | N/A | Normative |

---

## I. Purpose

Define the canonical class-configuration workflow for evolving a class's economic policy through immutable, versioned economic engines.

This FEAT governs:

- creating a new EconomicEngine version with new policy parameters;
- transitioning a class feature to use a new economic engine version;
- scheduling policy transitions for future activation (SPEC-ECON-002: future-law visibility);
- preserving complete audit trail of all economic policy versions (INV-ARC-016).

This FEAT is the sole lawful writer for the `economic_engine` table.

---

## II. Authority

This FEAT is authorized by:

- `DOM-CLASS-001_CANONICAL_CLASS_CONFIGURATION_DOMAIN.md`
- `DOM-CLASS-002_CLASS_ECONOMY_GOVERNANCE.md`
- `INV-CORE-000_CORE_INVARIANTS.md`
- `INV-CORE-001_CAPABILITY_BASED_ARCHITECTURE_AND_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md`
- `INV-ARC-015_TEMPORAL_MODEL_AND_BOUNDARY_ENFORCEMENT.md`
- `INV-ARC-016_LAWFUL_EXISTENCE_AND_AUDIT_LINEAGE.md`
- `SPEC-ECON-001_ECONOMIC_ENGINE_CONFIGURATION.md`
- `SPEC-ECON-002_FUTURE_LAW_VISIBILITY.md`

This FEAT is the sole lawful orchestrator for all mutations to the `economic_engine` table.

---

## III. Required Context

Required canonical context:

- `user_id`
- `class_id`
- `seat_id`
- `actor_role = teacher`

The teacher seat SHALL be lawful for the class boundary.

This FEAT SHALL NOT reconstruct authority from labels, block names, join codes, or route-local state.

---

## IV. Data Model

### Owned Table: `economic_engine`

Primary Key: `economic_version_id` (UUID)

| Column | Type | Constraint | Purpose |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| `economic_version_id` | UUID | PK, NOT NULL | Immutable version identifier |
| `class_id` | UUID | FK(classes), NOT NULL | Class this engine governs |
| `economy_policy_mode` | String | NOT NULL | Economic mode ('tight', 'default', 'comfortable') |
| `previous_version_id` | UUID | FK(economic_engine), nullable | Link to prior version (audit lineage) |
| `created_at` | DateTime(UTC) | NOT NULL | When this version was created |

**Immutability:** Once inserted, an `economic_engine` row is immutable (versioned history).

**Version Chain:** `previous_version_id` FK creates audit trail (`INV-ARC-016: Lawful Existence and Audit Lineage`).

---

## V. Primitive Operations

### V.1 Transition Economic Policy

**Command:** Create a new EconomicEngine version and link it to class features via `class_features` timeline.

**Required inputs:**
- `class_id`: Class to modify
- `new_policy_mode`: Target mode ('tight', 'default', 'comfortable')
- `effective_at`: When this policy transition takes effect (default: canonical_now per SPEC-TIME-001)
- `feature_list`: List of features affected by this transition (e.g., ['payroll', 'rent'])

**Preconditions:**
- `class_id` exists in `classes`
- `new_policy_mode` is one of ('tight', 'default', 'comfortable')
- All features in `feature_list` currently exist and are enabled
- `effective_at` is not in the past (or within allowed correction window)

**Postconditions:**
- New row inserted in `economic_engine`: `(economic_version_id=NEW_UUID, class_id, economy_policy_mode=new_policy_mode, previous_version_id=CURRENT_ENGINE_ID, created_at=now)`
- For each feature in `feature_list`: new row inserted in `class_features` linking the new engine version: `(class_id, feature, effective_at, economic_version_id=NEW_ENGINE_ID, deleted_at=NULL, created_at=now)`
- Query `get_effective_economic_engine(class_id, feature, effective_at)` returns the new engine version for all affected features
- Prior engine versions remain in table (audit trail)

**Failure contract:**
- `INVALID_POLICY_MODE`: new_policy_mode not in allowed values
- `CLASS_NOT_FOUND`: class_id not found
- `FEATURE_NOT_ENABLED`: One or more features in feature_list not currently enabled
- `INVALID_TEMPORAL_ORDER`: effective_at violates temporal constraints
- `INVALID_EFFECTIVE_AT`: effective_at is not a valid ISO 8601 datetime
- `NO_CURRENT_ENGINE`: No economic engine version found for class
- `INVALID_CONTEXT`: Missing canonical context
- `CLASS_SCOPE_MISMATCH`: class_id does not match canonical context
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: Actor is not a teacher
- `SEAT_NOT_FOUND`: Teacher seat not found
- `INVALID_FEATURE`: Feature name not in valid feature set
- `INVALID_FEATURE_LIST`: feature_list must be a non-empty list

---

## VI. Temporal Semantics

Per SPEC-TIME-001 and SPEC-ECON-002:

- `effective_at` (in `class_features`) determines when economic engine version becomes active
- `created_at` (in `economic_engine`) records when the version was authored
- Example: Engine created Aug 20, effective Sep 1 (teacher schedules policy change)
- Example: Engine created Aug 20, effective Aug 20 (immediate activation)
- Queries use `effective_at` in `class_features` to determine which engine governs at a point in time
- Version chain via `previous_version_id` preserves complete policy history

---

## VII. Guarantees

This FEAT guarantees:

- economic engine versions are immutable and versioned;
- policy transitions are time-scoped and explicit;
- complete audit trail of all policy versions preserved (INV-ARC-016);
- future-law scheduling is supported (SPEC-ECON-002);
- version chain enables temporal queries and analysis;
- no economic engine mutations occur outside this FEAT.

---

## VIII. Cross-Domain Coordination

This FEAT writes to:

- `economic_engine` — create immutable version row
- `class_features` — link features to new engine version

This FEAT reads from:

- `classes` — verify class exists
- `class_features` — verify current feature state and engine

This FEAT coordinates with:

- `FEAT-CLASS-004` — Feature enablement may trigger engine creation
- `FEAT-CLASS-001` — Class creation requires initial engine version
- `FEAT-ECON-001` — Economic policy orchestration may delegate to this FEAT

---

## IX. Atomicity & Transaction Boundary

Economic policy transitions SHALL execute atomically:

- Creation of new `economic_engine` row
- Insertion of all affected `class_features` rows linking to new engine

If any operation fails, entire transaction rolls back. Partial updates are forbidden.

---

## X. Idempotency

Policy transitions are naturally idempotent on the (class_id, feature, effective_at) tuple:

- Replaying "transition to 'default' mode effective 2026-08-20 for [payroll]" twice:
  - First replay: creates engine + class_features rows
  - Second replay: attempts to insert duplicate primary key in `class_features` (database constraint prevents duplicates)
  - Both replays result in same final state

No explicit idempotency token required for basic operations. Replay safety is guaranteed by primary key uniqueness.

---

## XI. Unified Pricing Rebalance Boundary

The Economic Engine may coordinate a class-scoped review of configured prices,
but it does not become the authority for another domain's state.

The review resolves the newest effective configuration for the canonical
`class_id`, displays only values outside the owning feature's canonical CWI
range, and requires an explicit teacher selection. A selected non-insurance
row may propose the exact midpoint or a teacher-entered amount bounded by that
range. The mutation is then delegated to the owning command:

- Rent and rent late penalties use the append-only rent supersession command.
- Store prices use Store product-version supersession.
- Overdraft/NSF fees use the Economic Engine evolution command.
- Insurance is advisory-only: it is never selectable or mutated here because
  premium changes can alter payout and coverage terms. The row links to
  Insurance Management for the complete policy edit flow.

Each selected mutation remains class-scoped, append-only, idempotent, and
atomic within the rebalance command boundary. Historical assessments,
entitlements, claims, and ledger facts are never rewritten.

## XII. Unified CWI Helper Contract

Every teacher-facing pricing surface coordinated by this FEAT SHALL present the
configured amount in classroom currency first, followed by its CWI share, the
applicable reference range, the value's position relative to that range, and
the owning surface's consequence primitive defined by `SPEC-ECON-003`. The
Helper MUST NOT present a bare ratio as the primary explanation or predict
optional purchases, claims, fines, or savings behavior.
