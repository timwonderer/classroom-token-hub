# FEAT-CORE-000: Feature Execution Constitutional Directive

| Reference Number | Version | Effective Date | Supersedes | Authority Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FEAT-CORE-000 | 1.1 | 2026-09-30 | 1.0 | Constitutional. Subordinate to `INV-CORE-000`, `INV-CORE-001`, and `INV-ARC-006`. |

---

## I. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory execution contract for all Feature Execution (FEAT) units.

A FEAT is the only legal mechanism by which:
* state is mutated
* money is moved
* identity is bound
* cross-domain coordination occurs


Any behavior outside this contract is considered non-compliant.

This directive additionally governs lawful orchestration of constitutional economic policy evolution: each change is a new row in its owning domain's table, carrying the instant from which it governs (`DOM-CLASS-003` §V, §VII). *(1.1, operator ruling 2026-09-30: there is no policy transition or activation step; the class-wide lineage tables that held them are retired.)*

---

## II. Definition of a FEAT

A FEAT is an atomic orchestration unit that:
1. Resolves identity context
2. Validates intent across domains
3. Executes state mutations within a single transaction boundary
4. Emits an auditable execution trace

A FEAT:
* **MAY** call Domains (guards, queries, commands)
* **MUST NOT** call another FEAT executor (no FEAT-to-FEAT execution; see §V.1)
* **MUST NOT** be bypassed by routes, jobs, or scripts

Monetary FEATs that move funds MUST, inside their own single FEAT context,
construct an intended ledger plan and resolve/apply it through the Ledger
**domain commands** (`build_intended_ledger_plan` / `resolve_intended_ledger_plan`
/ `apply_resolved_ledger_plan` — plain domain functions, not FEAT executors). A
money-moving FEAT does **not** execute a separate "FEAT-LED-000" / "FEAT-LED-001"
(that would be forbidden FEAT-to-FEAT execution; see §V.1).

---

## III. Core Execution Requirements

### 1. Context-First Execution (MANDATORY)
A FEAT **MUST** resolve:
* `user_id`
* `seat_id`
* `class_id`

before any domain interaction occurs.

**Failure Contract:**
If context cannot be resolved:
* execution **MUST** abort
* no state mutation is allowed
* an audit event **MUST** be emitted via DOM-OPS

### 2. Single Transaction Boundary (MANDATORY)
A FEAT **MUST** execute within a single atomic transaction.

The transaction **MUST** include:
* all ledger entries
* all domain state mutations derived from the action
* all correlation identifiers linking them
* every economic policy row the action records

**Failure Behavior:**
* partial writes are forbidden
* any failure **MUST** trigger full rollback

### 3. Idempotency (MANDATORY)
Every FEAT **MUST** be safe to retry.

**Requirements:**
* an `idempotency_key` **MUST** be accepted or generated.
* duplicate executions **MUST NOT** produce duplicate effects.
* **Scope:** Idempotency MUST apply to identity binding, entitlement creation, and obligation state transitions, in addition to ledger entries.
* ledger duplication **MUST** be prevented at the database level.
* replayed economic policy changes MUST NOT record a policy row twice.

### 4. Audit Logging & Correlation (MANDATORY)
Every FEAT execution **MUST** emit an audit record via DOM-OPS containing:
* FEAT identifier
* actor (`user_id`, `seat_id`, `class_id`)
* `correlation_id`: A unique identifier that MUST be generated and propagated for all multi-step, linked, or reversible operations.
* input payload (sanitized)
* result (success/failure)
* timestamp

**Failure to log = non-compliant execution**

---

## IV. Domain Interaction Rules

### 1. Domain Isolation (MANDATORY)
Domains:
* **MUST NOT** call other domains
* **MUST NOT** orchestrate workflows
* **MUST NOT** initiate ledger writes outside their scope

All cross-domain coordination **MUST** occur inside a FEAT.

This includes lawful orchestration of economic policy changes through their owning commands.

### 2. Validation vs Mutation Separation (MANDATORY)
Domains **MAY**:
* validate conditions
* return eligibility / constraint responses

Domains **MUST NOT**:
* mutate state during validation
* trigger side effects implicitly

**Ordering Guarantee:**
A FEAT **MUST NOT** perform any state mutation until all validation phases (across all involved domains) complete successfully.

**Example (Prohibited):**
* Store validation triggering overdraft fee before purchase success is guaranteed.

**Correct Pattern:**
* FEAT performs validation → FEAT performs mutation explicitly.

### 3. Guard Pattern Standardization (MANDATORY)
To ensure consistent cross-domain enforcement, all "Domain Guards" MUST follow a standardized interface:

**Pattern:**
`DOM-[DOMAIN].check_[CONDITION](context_id) -> { allowed: bool, reason: enum, metadata: dict }`

**Requirements:**
* Guards MUST be read-only.
* Guards MUST return a machine-readable `reason` code (Enum).
* FEATs MUST handle both `allowed: true` and `allowed: false` outcomes explicitly.
* Guards MUST NOT throw exceptions for business-level rejections; they must return `allowed: false`.

### 3. Ledger Authority (MANDATORY)
All money movement **MUST** be executed through DOM-LED.

No domain may:
* create implicit financial effects
* bypass ledger recording
* simulate balance changes

---

## V. FEAT Composition Rules

### 1. No FEAT-to-FEAT Execution

A FEAT executor **MUST NOT** invoke another FEAT executor — directly or
indirectly, and regardless of correlation-ID equality. This holds for **every**
FEAT; there is **no Core-FEAT carve-out**. The earlier "Core FEATs MAY be called
by other FEATs" allowance (`FEAT-PAY-POST`, `FEAT-IDEN-LOGIN`, `FEAT-LED-000`) is
**removed** — it is superseded by the higher-authority execution model:

* INV-ARC-000 §VIII.2 — *exactly one command path executes per request*;
* INV-ARC-021 §V.2 — the FEAT is the **only** construct permitted to compose
  logic across domains, **within a single execution path**;
* INV-ARC-006 — all mutation occurs inside explicit **domain commands**.

Shared functionality is invoked through domain-level guards, queries, and
commands (plain domain functions / services), never through another FEAT. For
example, a money-moving FEAT composes the Ledger **domain commands**
(`resolve_intended_ledger_plan` / `apply_resolved_ledger_plan`, which are plain
domain functions, not FEAT executors) inside its own single context — it does not
execute a "FEAT-LED-000".

Enforcement: the runtime `FEATContext` guard rejects entering any FEAT context
while another is active (regardless of feat_name/correlation), and a structural CI
check forbids a FEAT module from importing another FEAT's executor.

---

## VI. Side-Effect Governance

### 1. Explicit Side Effects Only (MANDATORY)
No FEAT may trigger hidden or implicit side effects.

All side effects **MUST** be:
* explicitly declared
* executed within the transaction boundary
* traceable via audit logs

**Example (Prohibited):**
* Payroll implicitly mutating economic policy state

**Correct Pattern:**
* FEAT emits event → separate FEAT handles rebalance
* A change for a later boundary is recorded now as a row dated to that boundary; nothing activates it

### 2. Post-Execution Events (ALLOWED)
FEATs **MAY** emit events for downstream processing:
* analytics
* policy-governance analysis
* notifications

These **MUST**:
* be emitted **ONLY AFTER** a successful transaction commit.
* not mutate core state within the originating transaction.
* be idempotent and replay-safe.

---

## VII. Identity Authority Rules

### 1. Seat as Execution Context (MANDATORY)
All FEAT execution **MUST** be scoped to a resolved `seat_id`.

No FEAT may operate using:
* raw `user_id` alone
* `join_code` as authority
* global identity lookups

### 2. Binding Integrity (MANDATORY)
Identity binding operations **MUST**:
* occur only within `FEAT-IDEN-*`
* be atomic
* not leak intermediate states

---

## VIII. Prohibited Patterns

The following are explicitly forbidden:
1. Route-level business logic that mutates multiple domains
2. Domain calling another domain
3. Ledger mutation during validation phase
4. Partial state updates without ledger correlation
5. Hidden entitlement creation without ledger trace (unless explicitly zero-value and declared)
6. Context-less execution (no `seat_id`)
7. Reconstruction of authoritative state from non-authoritative sources (e.g., using ledger as attendance truth)
8. Direct mutation of constitutional economic policy state instead of appending a row to the owning table
9. Hidden delayed economic mutation that is not a visible, effective-dated row
10. Operational domains rewriting a policy row

---

## IX. Compliance Requirements

All FEAT implementations **MUST**:
* declare required context inputs
* define transaction boundary scope
* specify idempotency mechanism
* emit audit logs
* pass invariant checks post-execution
* record economic governance changes as new rows of the owning table

**CI SHOULD enforce:**
* no direct domain-to-domain calls
* no route-level multi-domain mutation
* presence of audit logging
* presence of idempotency handling
* prohibition against in-place mutation of an economic policy row

---

## X. Execution Boundary Enforcement (MANDATORY)

All state mutation **MUST** originate from a FEAT.

The following are prohibited from performing direct mutations:
* Routes (Flask handlers)
* Background jobs
* CLI scripts

These **MUST** invoke a FEAT instead to interact with domain state.

Constitutional economic policy evolution MUST occur through FEAT-orchestrated execution of the owning domain's command.

Direct mutation of an economic policy row outside FEAT execution is prohibited.

### 1. Technical Enforcement Mechanisms (RECOMMENDED)
To ensure compliance, the implementation SHOULD utilize:
* **Context Decorators**: `@requires_feat_context` on domain mutation methods.
* **DB Assertions**: A database wrapper that asserts a valid `FEAT_EXECUTION_CONTEXT` is present before committing.
* **Linting Rules**: CI checks to detect `db.session.add/commit` calls outside the `/app/features/` directory.
