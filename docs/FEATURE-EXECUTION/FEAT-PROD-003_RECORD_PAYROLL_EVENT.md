# FEAT-PROD-003: Record Payroll Event

| Reference Number | Version | Effective Date | Supersedes | Authority Level |

| FEAT-PROD-003 | 1.3 | 2026-09-30 | 1.2 | Normative |

## I. Purpose

This FEAT records payroll business events for the Productivity and Payroll domain and coordinates the corresponding Ledger posting.

It writes to `payroll_event` only.

The FEAT covers:

- attendance-based payroll credits
- teacher-entered manual credits
- reversals of either of the above

This FEAT uses `CanonicalContext` for live request authority and the canonical temporal resolver for recording and presenting class-local timestamps.

---

## II. Execution Context

### 1. Required Inputs

- `ctx`: `CanonicalContext`
- `target_seat_id`: seat receiving the credit or reversal effect
- `idempotency_key`: replay guard
- `policy_uuid`: for a `manual_credit` posting another domain's calculation, the `payroll_settings.policy_uuid` that calculation used; omitted for a teacher-entered manual credit. For a `payroll` event it is not an input: the FEAT resolves it while pricing (see Rules). *(Operator ruling 2026-09-30: the former `policy_version_id` input named a row of the `policy_versions` table, which was never an authority for payroll and is retired (1.3).)*
- `mechanism`: `TEACHER` or `SYSTEM`, supplied by the initiating caller; for `payroll`, `SYSTEM` means the automatic schedule started the run
- `payroll_run_type`: `payroll`, `manual_credit`, or `reversal`
- `correlation_id`: business-to-ledger linkage
- `summary_json`: human-readable and structured metadata
- `reference_time_utc`: optional explicit timestamp for deterministic evaluation

### 2. Canonical Authority

- `ctx.class_id` provides the class boundary
- `ctx.seat_id` provides the lawful actor seat for live requests
- `ctx.actor_role` determines whether the action is teacher-driven or system-driven

The FEAT MUST not infer monetary authority from the target seat.

## III. Canonical Write

### `record_payroll_event(...)`

This is the only lawful mutation path for `payroll_event`.

Typical use cases:

- automatic payroll run based on attendance
- teacher-entered manual credit
- reversal of a prior payroll or manual credit event

Rules:

- MUST require `class_id`, `actor_seat_id`, `target_seat_id`, `correlation_id`, `idempotency_key`, `mechanism`, `payroll_run_type`, `recorded_at`, and `summary_json`
- MUST record policy provenance according to the authority that determined the amount, not the storage event type alone:
  - `payroll` (amount priced by the payroll settings from attendance/hours): `policy_uuid` is REQUIRED; each settled session is priced by the `payroll_settings` row in force when it closed, and `summary_json` records every setting's `policy_uuid`, priced seconds, and per-minute `pay_rate` (`DOM-PROD-001` §XV.3)
  - `manual_credit` initiated by a teacher who enters the amount directly: no payroll policy is required, and a class with no payroll configuration can still record it
  - `manual_credit` used as the posting mechanism for another domain's lawful calculation (for example a productivity insurance reimbursement): MUST retain the policy provenance that calculation used
  - `reversal`: carries the provenance of the event it compensates
- This is a minimum requirement for `payroll` events only. It MUST NOT be inverted into a rule that `manual_credit` events carry no policy provenance
- MUST read payroll settings only through the single payroll-settings resolver (`payroll_settings` only)
- MUST be append-only
- MUST set `payroll_run_type` to `payroll`, `manual_credit`, or `reversal`
- MUST use the original event's `correlation_id` when writing a reversal
- MUST not store the payroll amount on the domain row
- MUST not store payroll period boundaries as persisted fields
- MUST coordinate the ledger post using the same `correlation_id`

Execution steps:

1. Resolve `CanonicalContext` and confirm the actor is lawful for the class.
2. Resolve `CLE` with `canonical_temporal_resolver("CLE", primitive="current_time", canonical_execution_context=ctx, reference_time_utc=reference_time_utc)`.
3. Identify the target seat.
4. Compute the payroll amount from authoritative productivity facts, pricing each settled session by the setting in force when it closed, or take the manual credit intent.
5. Write the append-only `payroll_event` row with the immutable correlation ID.
6. Post the matching Ledger credit using the same `correlation_id`.
7. If the event is a reversal, compute and post the compensating negative Ledger amount from the original event lineage.

Failure conditions:

- missing original event for reversal
- no payroll setting to price a `payroll` event, or a supplied `policy_uuid` that is not a payroll setting of the class
- missing target seat or class boundary
- attempt to write a payroll amount directly onto the domain row

### `record_payroll_reversal(...)`

This is a specialized pathway that writes a compensating `payroll_event` row and coordinates the matching Ledger reversal.

Rules:

- MUST create a new `payroll_event` row with `payroll_run_type = reversal`
- MUST reuse the original event's `correlation_id`
- MUST compute the compensating amount from the original event lineage
- MUST post the matching Ledger movement as the negative of the original amount
- MUST not mutate the original payroll row

---

## IV. Temporal Rules

- Payroll event timestamps MUST be recorded in UTC.
- Payroll event timestamps MUST be displayed in class canonical time.
- Payroll period boundaries are derived from the ordered sequence of `payroll_event` rows.
- `manual_credit` and `reversal` rows do not advance the payroll boundary chain.

---

## V. Invariants

1. Payroll writes are append-only.
2. Payroll amount is derived and posted to Ledger, not stored on the domain row.
3. Reversal is a compensating event with the same correlation ID as the original.
4. The FEAT must fail closed if the original event cannot be established.
