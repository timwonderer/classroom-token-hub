# FEAT-PROD-003: Record Payroll Event

| Reference Number | Version | Effective Date | Supersedes | Authority Level |

## I. Purpose

This FEAT records payroll business events for the Productivity and Payroll domain and coordinates the corresponding Ledger posting.

It writes to `payroll_event` only.

The FEAT covers:

- attendance-based payroll credits
- teacher-entered manual credits
- reversals of either of the above

This FEAT uses `CanonicalContext` for live request authority and the canonical temporal resolver for recording and presenting class-local timestamps.

---

## II. Execution Context

### 1. Required Inputs

- `ctx`: `CanonicalContext`
- `target_seat_id`: seat receiving the credit or reversal effect
- `idempotency_key`: replay guard
- `policy_version_id`: the policy version that priced the amount; required for `payroll`, omitted for a teacher-entered manual credit (see Rules)
- `payroll_run_type`: `payroll`, `manual_credit`, or `reversal`
- `correlation_id`: business-to-ledger linkage
- `summary_json`: human-readable and structured metadata
- `reference_time_utc`: optional explicit timestamp for deterministic evaluation

### 2. Canonical Authority

- `ctx.class_id` provides the class boundary
- `ctx.seat_id` provides the lawful actor seat for live requests
- `ctx.actor_role` determines whether the action is teacher-driven or system-driven

The FEAT MUST not infer monetary authority from the target seat.

---

## III. Canonical Write

### `record_payroll_event(...)`

This is the only lawful mutation path for `payroll_event`.

Typical use cases:

- automatic payroll run based on attendance
- teacher-entered manual credit
- reversal of a prior payroll or manual credit event

Rules:

- MUST require `class_id`, `actor_seat_id`, `target_seat_id`, `correlation_id`, `idempotency_key`, `mechanism`, `payroll_run_type`, `recorded_at`, and `summary_json`
- MUST record policy provenance according to the authority that determined the amount, not the storage event type alone:
  - `payroll` (amount priced by the payroll policy from attendance/hours): `policy_version_id` and `policy_uuid` are REQUIRED
  - `manual_credit` initiated by a teacher who enters the amount directly: no payroll policy is required, and a class with no payroll configuration can still record it
  - `manual_credit` used as the posting mechanism for another domain's lawful calculation (for example a productivity insurance reimbursement): MUST retain the policy provenance that calculation used
  - `reversal`: carries the provenance of the event it compensates
- This is a minimum requirement for `payroll` events only. It MUST NOT be inverted into a rule that `manual_credit` events carry no policy version
- MUST be append-only
- MUST set `payroll_run_type` to `payroll`, `manual_credit`, or `reversal`
- MUST use the original event's `correlation_id` when writing a reversal
- MUST not store the payroll amount on the domain row
- MUST not store payroll period boundaries as persisted fields
- MUST coordinate the ledger post using the same `correlation_id`

Execution steps:

1. Resolve `CanonicalContext` and confirm the actor is lawful for the class.
2. Resolve `CLE` with `canonical_temporal_resolver("CLE", primitive="current_time", canonical_execution_context=ctx, reference_time_utc=reference_time_utc)`.
3. Identify the target seat and the payroll policy version in effect.
4. Compute the payroll amount from authoritative productivity facts or manual credit intent.
5. Write the append-only `payroll_event` row with the immutable correlation ID.
6. Post the matching Ledger credit using the same `correlation_id`.
7. If the event is a reversal, compute and post the compensating negative Ledger amount from the original event lineage.

Failure conditions:

- missing original event for reversal
- missing policy version
- missing target seat or class boundary
- attempt to write a payroll amount directly onto the domain row

### `record_payroll_reversal(...)`

This is a specialized pathway that writes a compensating `payroll_event` row and coordinates the matching Ledger reversal.

Rules:

- MUST create a new `payroll_event` row with `payroll_run_type = reversal`
- MUST reuse the original event's `correlation_id`
- MUST compute the compensating amount from the original event lineage
- MUST post the matching Ledger movement as the negative of the original amount
- MUST not mutate the original payroll row

---

## IV. Temporal Rules

- Payroll event timestamps MUST be recorded in UTC.
- Payroll event timestamps MUST be displayed in class canonical time.
- Payroll period boundaries are derived from the ordered sequence of `payroll_event` rows.
- `manual_credit` and `reversal` rows do not advance the payroll boundary chain.

---

## V. Invariants

1. Payroll writes are append-only.
2. Payroll amount is derived and posted to Ledger, not stored on the domain row.
3. Reversal is a compensating event with the same correlation ID as the original.
4. The FEAT must fail closed if the original event cannot be established.
