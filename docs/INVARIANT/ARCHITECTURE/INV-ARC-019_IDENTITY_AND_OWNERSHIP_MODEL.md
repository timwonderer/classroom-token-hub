# INV-ARC-019: Identity and Ownership Model

| Reference Number | Version | Effective Date | Supersedes | Authority Level |

| INV-ARC-019      | 1.3     | 2026-09-06     | 1.2 | Constitutional |

---

## I. Purpose

This document defines the canonical identity and ownership boundaries for Classroom Token Hub (CTH) V2. It ensures a clear separation between global authentication principals, class-local operational actors, isolation boundaries, public reference keys, and presentation profiles.

---

## II. Scope

This model applies system-wide to database schema design, session management, routing logic, and capability validation across all domains and feature executors.

---

## III. Authority Level

Constitutional (Tier 1) within `INV-ARC`. Derived from `INV-CORE-000` Section III.4, `Principal and Actor Authority`, and governed within the hierarchy described by `INV-CORE-001`. This protocol is subordinate to foundational invariants.

## IV. Dependencies

- `docs/INVARIANT/CORE/INV-CORE-001_CAPABILITY_BASED_ARCHITECTURE_AND_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md`
- `docs/SPEC/SPEC-SEC-001_CREDENTIALS_AND_IDENTITY_LOOKUP_CODE_CONTRACT.md` (incorporated; see Section VI)

---

## V. Core Principle

Every runtime object has one authoritative owner.

Identity resolution must answer these questions separately:

1. Who authenticated?
2. Who acted?
3. In which boundary?
4. How is the actor referenced publicly?
5. What capability is being granted?

No identifier answers more than its assigned question.

## VI. Authentication Principal

### `users.id`

`users.id` identifies the authenticated human principal.

`users` owns:

- authentication credentials
- student account recovery
- session establishment
- last class context
- TOTP
- user roles


`users` does not own:

- attendance
- hall passes
- economy operations
- student interactions
- support tickets
- class-local claim verification artifacts
- display identity

Passkey metadata is stored in the unified `passkey_credentials` table for both teacher and sysadmin, and the owning
principal is always `users.id`.

### Incorporation of SPEC-SEC-001

This document assigns ownership of authentication credentials to `users`, but ownership alone does
not say how a credential is constructed, verified, or failed. That code-level contract is
`SPEC-SEC-001`, which by its own Section III is "binding only where incorporated by a governing
`INV-*`, `DOM-*`, or `FEAT-*` contract." No `DOM-*` contract sits above credential material —
`DOM-IDEN-002` and `DOM-IDEN-003` name the fields (`pin_hash`, `passphrase_hash`) and deliberately
specify no algorithm. This section is therefore the incorporating authority.

The following parts of `SPEC-SEC-001` are incorporated and binding on all code in this repository:

- **Section V.1, Credential material.** One canonical password-hashing primitive; the scrypt profile
  `scrypt:32768:8:1` with a per-hash random salt in the encoded verifier format; no application
  secret as a KDF input; verifier-only storage; boolean-only verification results with algorithm and
  parameters centralized in the primitive rather than duplicated at call sites; and fail-closed,
  non-disclosing handling of unusable verifiers.
- **Section V.2, Lookup and PII representation**, to the extent it governs identity lookup digests.
  The storage *forms* those digests may take remain owned by `INV-ARC-018` Section V, which
  incorporates the same specification for that purpose.
- **Section V.3.1**, that authentication establishes `users.id` and does not by itself establish
  `seat_id` or `class_id`. This restates in code terms what Section V of this document requires:
  no identifier answers more than its assigned question.
- **Section V.4, Recovery and capability artifacts**, consistent with Section XIV's settled decision
  that recovery tokens are user-owned recovery capability.

Two consequences follow that are easy to get wrong in code and are stated here so they are not
rediscovered as preferences:

1. `PEPPER_KEY` is not a credential input. It keys deterministic lookup digests only. Peppering
   passwords would couple every credential to a key whose rotation is a lookup-digest migration
   event, silently converting it into a credential-invalidating event. `SPEC-SEC-001` Section V.1.3
   prohibits this, and Section V.1a requires the rotation semantics of each key to stay independent.
2. Because the KDF profile is fixed by specification rather than by a library default, code must not
   rely on a dependency's default to supply it. A default that happens to match is a coincidence
   that a future upgrade may end, and `SPEC-SEC-001` Section VII prohibits substituting parameters
   outside those it governs.

## VII. Operational Actor

### `seats.id`

`seats.id` identifies one actor operating inside one class.

`seats` owns actor attribution for:

- attendance
- hall passes
- payroll
- banking
- store
- rent
- insurance
- support tickets
- student detail pages
- classroom actions

`seats` also owns class-local claim state:

- claim lifecycle
- claim verification hashes
- claimed/unclaimed state
- authority to bind one user to one participant position in one class

Name-lookup hashes used during roster claim belong on the seat because they prove
entitlement to a specific class-local participant position. They are not global user
identity and they are not display identity.

Teacher seats and student seats follow the same actor model.

## VIII. Isolation Boundary

### `classes.class_id`

`classes.class_id` defines the boundary in which actors operate.

`classes` owns:

- membership boundary
- economy configuration
- policies
- feature enablement
- class labels
- classroom state

`join_code` is a human-facing class alias. It may locate a class for invitation,
claim, or routing convenience, but it MUST resolve to `class_id` before any
authority-sensitive operation.

## IX. Public Actor Identity

### `seats.public_id`

`seats.public_id` is the single canonical deidentified public actor identifier.

Rules:

- It is a UUID encoded as a 36-character string.
- It carries no human-readable or role-specific meaning.
- It is stable for the lifetime of the seat.
- It is safe to expose where a class-scoped actor must be referenced without exposing
  the internal `seats.id`.
- It MUST resolve under the active `class_id`.
- It MUST NOT grant authority by itself.

Use `seats.public_id` for:

- actor URLs
- teacher-facing participant lookup
- support correlation
- ticket actor attribution
- class-scoped analytics drilldowns

The following are invalid v2 residue, not supported identity alternatives:

- `Admin.public_id`
- `Admin.teacher_public_id`
- `Student.opaque_reference`
- separate TLCP actor identity families

`Student.internal_reference` is separate internal-locator residue. The canonical internal reference MAY be a combination of `users.id`, `class_id`, or `seats.id`

Named cleanup debt:

- `TLCP-SCHEMA-001` — complete as of 2026-06-02. Physical TLCP actor
  columns/API labels now use `actor_public_id` and store `Seat.public_id`.

## X. Display Identity

### `identity_profiles`

`identity_profiles` owns presentation-only identity, including display names and
visible identity attributes.

Display identity does not participate in authentication, authority, ownership
resolution, or actor lookup.

Do not store claim artifacts, credential artifacts, or class authority in
`identity_profiles`.

## XI. Capability Tokens

Capability tokens grant permission to perform one defined action. They are not users,
seats, classes, or public actor identities.

Examples:

- `hall_pass_verify_token`
- recovery tokens
- claim tokens
- passkey credential metadata

Every capability design must answer two questions explicitly:

1. Which object owns the token?
2. Which `class_id`, if any, constrains its use?

Settled ownership:

- Student recovery capability is owned and executed by `users` 
- passkey capability is owned by `users` and stored in `passkey_credentials` (jointly used by teacher and sysadmin). Ownership is keyed by `users.id`
- roster claim verification is owned by `seats`

Ownership of `hall_pass_verify_token` SHALL be owned by `users` where `user_role = teacher`. The `hall_pass_verify_token` is a form of capability token that authorize the holder to access hall pass verification feature.

## XII. Roster Provisioning and Seat Claim

Roster upload provisions a future participant position. It does not create a
student-authenticated principal.

When a teacher uploads a roster:

1. A class exists or is created.
2. A `users` row is provisioned as an inactive authentication shell.
3. A `seats` row is provisioned and bound to the class.
4. An `identity_profiles` row is provisioned and bound one-to-one to the seat.
5. Claim artifacts are stored on the seat.
6. No credentials are activated yet.

Claim/setup later proves entitlement to the seat and activates credentials on
`users`.

## XIII. Runtime Context

The authenticated principal and active classroom context remain separate:

- `users.id` establishes who authenticated.
- `seats.id` establishes who acts.
- `classes.class_id` establishes where the actor acts.
- `seats.public_id` exposes the actor externally without exposing `seats.id`.

The session MUST NOT infer an actor or boundary from display fields, role-specific
public identifiers, legacy numeric participant IDs, or aliases once canonical context
is available.

## XIV. Settled Decisions

- `users.id` = authentication principal
- `seats.id` = operational actor
- `classes.class_id` = isolation boundary
- `seats.public_id` = canonical deidentified public actor identity
- `identity_profiles` = display-only identity
- `join_code` = boundary alias that resolves to `class_id`
- roster lookup hashes = seat-owned claim verification artifacts
- recovery tokens = user-owned recovery capability
- passkey metadata = user-owned authentication capability
- credential construction and verification = `SPEC-SEC-001` Section V.1, incorporated by Section VI
  of this document; `PEPPER_KEY` is a lookup-digest key and is never a credential input

## XV. Open Decisions

- `hall_pass_verify_token` ownership and boundary scope
- invalid public identifier residue removal order
- bridge-table retirement order

## XVI. Amendment

Revisions to this document must increment the version number, update the effective date, and remain consistent with foundational documentation standards and core invariants.
