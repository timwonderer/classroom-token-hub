# --- Ledger provenance classifier (SPEC-ITR-001 §6.3) ----------------------
#
# The Interpretation domain classifies ledger rows by origin without ever
# consulting ``Transaction.type`` (INV-ITR-015). A row is *student-originated*
# iff it is a self-mechanism, non-reversal, non-void row whose ``feat_code`` is
# NOT one of the system-originated FEATs enumerated below. SPEC-ITR-001 §6.6
# defers the concrete enumeration to the implementing surface; the Ledger domain
# owns the provenance of its own rows, so the set lives here.
#
# Categories (SPEC-ITR-001 §6.3): payroll accrual, interest accrual, obligation
# assessment, admin adjustment, ledger resolution. Student-agency FEATs
# (FEAT-STOR-001 purchase, FEAT-OBL-001 rent self-payment, transfers) are
# deliberately excluded so those acts remain student-originated.
