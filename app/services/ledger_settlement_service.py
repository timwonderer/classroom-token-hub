    transaction boundary, so the settlement is durably committed and one
    context's failure does not stop the run. Establishing the FEAT context is
    mandatory: settlement mutates Transaction and LedgerBalanceSnapshot rows,
    and FEAT-INTEGRITY blocks any flush/commit of mutated state outside a
    verified FEAT context (see app/feats/base.py). Without this boundary the
    standalone scheduled sweep (scripts/settle_pending_transactions.py) would
    raise on the first flush and settle nothing.

    When invoked while another FEAT is already active (composed automation),
    each FEAT-LED-003 boundary nests as a savepoint under that parent, which
    owns the durable commit.
