"""System-owned TRANSACTION insurance eligibility law (Step 6, rule 4).

This module is CTH's canonical, domain-owned authority for *which* ledger
transactions may lawfully back a TRANSACTION insurance claim. It is deliberately
NOT Class Configuration: the disallowed set is fixed system law and a teacher
cannot widen (or narrow) it. Keeping the predicate here means FEAT-STOR-003 asks one
question ("is this transaction a lawful TRANSACTION claim basis?") and never
embeds a magic list of transaction categories.

A TRANSACTION claim's source transaction must satisfy ALL of:

* it is a **loss** — negative from the covered seat's perspective;
* it **belongs** to the covered seat and class;
* its category/type is **not** in CTH's global disallowed-insurance set;
* it is **not** a transfer;
* it is **not** obligation-related (rent / property tax);
* it is **not** collective-goal-related;
* if it is **item-related**, the associated entitlement must have been purchased
  and **USED** (a CONSUMED event exists) and must **not** be REVOKED or EXPIRED.

Two orthogonal gates live in the FEAT, not here, because they need temporal /
claim-history context rather than transaction structure: the **filing window**
(transaction date → submission, class-local calendar days) and the
**one-transaction-one-claim** uniqueness guard.
