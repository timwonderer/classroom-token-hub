"""Policies-domain commands for the rent policy definition (DOM-POL-001).

``rent_settings`` is an append-only, immutable repository: ``policy_uuid`` *is* the
version (DOM-POL-001 §VI.0). A teacher "editing" rent does not update a row — it
inserts a new one and retires the prior one. Callers must go through
``supersede_rent_settings`` rather than assigning to a fetched row; the model's
``before_update`` guard rejects in-place payload edits outright.

    This is the ONLY lawful way to change a class's rent terms. Per DOM-POL-001
    §VI.1 every submission — first-time or resubmission — produces a new row with a
    new ``policy_uuid``, and the backend must not infer whether a change is
    "meaningful": a submission is a new contract.

    The new row inherits every payload field from the current policy and then
    applies ``updates``, so a partial submission (the rebalancer changes only
    ``rent_amount``) carries the rest of the contract forward instead of silently
    reverting it to column defaults. The prior row is marked ``RETIRED`` so exactly
    one ``IN_USE`` row remains selectable for new work; it stays readable forever so
    the assessments that froze its ``policy_uuid`` can still resolve their amounts.
