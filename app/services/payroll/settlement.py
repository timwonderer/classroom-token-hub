"""Class-wide payroll-cycle settlement (DOM-PROD-001 §XV, slice 8.3b).

Owns exactly one thing: given a ``class_id``, a ``payroll_cycle_id``, and a lawful
resolved cycle boundary, settle the entire eligible class under the currently
governing payroll configuration, stamping the same ``payroll_cycle_id`` on every
payroll event produced.

    enumerate eligible seats (attendance-derived, PROD doctrine)
        -> derive each seat's pay window/facts (the per-seat primitive)
        -> invoke record_payroll_event (payroll_event_type="payroll")
        -> stamp the shared payroll_cycle_id on every event
        -> NO COMMIT

It is deliberately ignorant of ITR, CLASS policy activation, and the
completion/replay anchor — those are composed by the FEAT-PROD-004 orchestrator in
a later slice. It emits only ``payroll`` events; it never manufactures
``manual_credit`` or ``reversal`` events, so teacher credits and reversals never
become cycle-boundary events. It ``add``/``flush``es within the caller's FEAT
transaction and never commits, so a single per-seat failure lets the caller roll
the entire transaction back.
