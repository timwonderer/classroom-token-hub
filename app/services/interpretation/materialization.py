"""Interpretation cycle-record materialization writer (DOM-ITR-001 §IX, slice 8.2c).

The single command that turns a complete, lawful ``observations_json`` payload into
exactly **one immutable** ``interpretation_cycle_record`` for a completed economic
cycle. This is the first slice in which DOM-ITR lawfully creates history.

Responsibilities (and only these):

1. **Re-validate, never trust.** Re-run ``validate_for_materialization`` inside the
   writer — the caller's claim that the payload is complete is irrelevant; the
   serializer-derived completeness gate (SPEC-ITR-001 §15.8) is re-evaluated here
   and fails closed if the payload is not exactly-complete and lawful.
2. **Freeze the reference configuration** from authoritative CLASS/economic reads
   at the cycle boundary (§VII), so the record is self-describing.
3. **Write exactly one record per ``(class_id, payroll_cycle_id)``** (§IX).
4. **Idempotent replay, fail-closed conflict.** Re-presenting the same cycle with
   the same canonical payload and reference configuration is idempotent success.
   Re-presenting the same cycle with *different* content is an integrity violation:
   the record is immutable, so the writer rejects it — it never updates, overwrites,
   or recomputes.

The writer is deliberately **dumb about candidate meaning**: it knows nothing of
how Q3 or Q9 is computed, only that the payload passes the serialization contract
and that a lawful reference configuration was captured. It performs **no**
Analytics call. It ``add``s and ``flush``es within the caller's FEAT transaction
and never commits on its own, so any failure rolls back with that transaction;
FEAT-PROD-004 orchestration is wired in a later slice, not here.
