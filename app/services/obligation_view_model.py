Obligation View Models — Cross-Domain Composition

Derives presentation-ready obligation status by composing:
- Obligations domain: PAYMENT event references (ledger_transaction_id)
- Ledger domain: authoritative Transaction amounts
- Per DOM-OBL-001 §VIII: paid_amount = sum(Ledger amounts from PAYMENT events)

This is NOT a domain service. It is a composition layer that joins two
authoritative sources for presentation/read-model use.

Routes and templates call this layer to build complete obligation views.
Obligations and Ledger services remain isolated and own their own facts.
