"""POL storage/retrieval mechanism for immutable insurance policy definitions.

This is the generic Policies (POL) mechanism for the ``insurance_policies``
definition family (the STOR-owned, POL-managed definition-of-record introduced
in Step 1). It is the successor to the ``PolicyVersion(domain="insurance")``
residue in ``insurance_policy_service`` — the old path drove the DOM-CLASS-003
*economic* version-control tables (``policy_versions`` / ``policy_transitions``:
integer id, ``version_number``, JSON payload, ``is_active``, lineage
transitions), whose shape is architecturally incompatible with the typed,
UUID-keyed, availability-projected ``insurance_policies`` table. This module
does NOT reuse that abstraction and provides no fallback to it.

Scope discipline (DOM-POL-001):

* POL is a *mechanism* domain: it stores and retrieves immutable definition
  rows. It performs **no semantic insurance validation** — it does not decide
  whether 60% reimbursement is appropriate, whether PRODUCTIVITY should carry a
  payout multiple, etc. FEAT-CLASS-003 validates contract conformance to
  SPEC-ECON-003 *before* delegating here. POL relies only on the DB integrity
  CHECKs as structural backstops.
* ``policy_uuid`` IS the version (DOM-POL-001 §VI.0). "Create" and "update" both
  produce a *new* immutable row with a *fresh* ``policy_uuid``; economic and
  identity fields are NEVER mutated in place.
* Only ``availability_state`` (and its retirement metadata) may change on an
  existing definition row (availability projection, DOM-POL-001 §IX).
* Retrieval/listing are class-scoped and fail closed on class mismatch.
* Deletion is intentionally NOT implemented here: DOM-POL-001 §VI.4 permits
  removing a RETIRED row only after live dependencies drain, and that
  dependency-draining path is not yet wired for this family. No new deletion
  policy is invented for insurance.

These functions perform ORM mutations and MUST be invoked inside an active FEAT
context (enforced by ``app.feats.base``). They are the domain-layer callee of
FEAT-POL-001, not a public route surface.
