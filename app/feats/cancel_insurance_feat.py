FEAT-OBL-005: Insurance Cancellation (stop renewal).

Cancellation of a lawfully purchased insurance policy is **stop-renewal**, not a
revoke or refund. Authority (EXPIRED-only model, confirmed against the docs):

- DOM-STORE-001 §1 — insurance ends at cycle boundaries; REVOKED is authorized
  only for non-insurance entitlement types.
- FEAT-STOR-002 §VIII / §IX.C / §XIV — a lawfully purchased insurance entitlement
  SHALL NOT be revoked or refunded; teacher cancellation is prospective; coverage
  is never expired early. (`INSURANCE_NON_REVOCABLE`.)
- DOM-OBL-001 §160/§241/§293 — termination is a terminal bill-cycle row
  (`next_assessment_at = NULL`) that stops future recurrence without rewriting
  prior obligation events.

What this FEAT does (and only this):
- resolve the seat's ACTIVE insurance entitlement for the policy and its premium
  lineage ``insurance:{entitlement_id}`` (DOM-OBL-001 §II.B),
- terminate that lineage at the end of the last committed period
  (DOM-OBL-001 §V.7; DOM-STORE-001 §VIII.E.1 "Stopping renewal"): the current
  period is committed; an advance-assessed next period is committed once any
  payment has been applied to its premium, and otherwise its premium is
  withdrawn in the same transaction (§V.8) and coverage ends at the current
  period's end.

What this FEAT explicitly does NOT do:
- it writes NO `REVOKED` and NO early `EXPIRED` entitlement event, and moves NO
  money (no refund). Coverage remains active and claimable until its cycle
  boundary; the terminal `EXPIRED` disposition lands at that boundary through the
  Store-owned boundary-expiry mechanism (FEAT-STOR-002), never here.

The seat↔lineage binding lives on the `assessment_events` the bill cycle drives
(FEAT-OBL-004 §VIII.5 / §IX; bill cycles are seat-blind). FEAT-OBL-004's §114 hard
invariant guarantees at most one concurrently-active entitlement per
(seat, policy_uuid), so the active lineage resolves unambiguously.

Execution model: one FEAT context composing the OBL domain command
``terminate_bill_cycle`` — never another FEAT executor (FEAT-CORE-000 §V.1).
