    Record lawful satisfaction of an assessed obligation.

    Per DOM-OBL-001 §IX.2:
    - PAYMENT may occur multiple times for partial payment
    - WAIVED is rent-only and closes outstanding remainder
    - WAIVED creates no Ledger movement

    Preconditions:
    - correlation_id identifies an existing ASSESSMENT
    - method is lawful for the assessment type (WAIVED only for RENT)
    - For PAYMENT: ledger_transaction_id references a lawful Ledger row
    - For PAYMENT: Ledger transaction belongs to same class/seat boundary
    - idempotency_key prevents duplicate satisfaction

    Postconditions:
    - exactly one satisfaction row created with event_type=PAYMENT or WAIVED
    - PAYMENT row references the Ledger transaction
    - WAIVED row has no Ledger reference
    - satisfaction rows are immutable
