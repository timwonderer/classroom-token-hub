    An admin adjustment is a teacher-applied credit or PENALTY (fine). A penalty
    is neither an intended purchase nor an existing obligation, so — per the
    economic model — it MUST NOT generate an NSF/overdraft fine, and it does not
    raid the student's savings to cover itself. It posts as a direct ledger
    debit/credit on the seat's own account (INV-ARC-019: anchored on class_id +
    seat_id), settling below zero if the balance cannot cover the penalty.

    ``declined_count`` / ``fee_count`` are retained on the result for backward
    compatibility and are always 0: penalties are never declined for insufficient
    funds and never incur a fee.
