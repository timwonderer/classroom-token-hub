"""
FEAT-OBL-002: Scheduled Rent Cycle — canonical rent reconciliation.

This is the SINGLE mechanism that materializes the recurring rent lifecycle for a
class. It is idempotent and safe to run repeatedly (on a schedule or on demand):

  - First run for a rent-enabled class with no cycle yet: create cycle 1 and one
    ASSESSMENT per claimed, non-exempt student seat.
  - Later runs: when the current cycle's ``next_assessment_at`` has been reached,
    create the successor cycle, assess it, and expire the PRIOR cycle's PERK
    hall passes at the rent boundary (DOM-OBL-001 §IX.9 / DOM-STORE-001 §VIII.6).
  - Runs before the boundary, or for a disabled class, are no-ops.

Layering (INV-ARC-006 / INV-ARC-021): reconciliation is a FEAT orchestrator. It
reads schedule INTENT from RentSettings, resolves concrete instants through the
Rent schedule producer, and drives the Obligations domain (via the assess /
advance-cycle FEATs) and the Store domain (via entitlement expiry). Each domain
still owns its own mutation; the FEAT only coordinates them under one transaction.

Lineage conventions (greenfield):
  - bill cycle:  internal_ref = "rent:{class_id}", cycle_number = 1, 2, 3, …
  - assessment:  internal_ref = "rent:{class_id}:{seat_id}",
                 correlation_id = "rent:{class_id}:{seat_id}:cycle:{cycle_number}"
