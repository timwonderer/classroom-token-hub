"""
FEAT-CLASS-003: Insurance Policy Management (orchestration boundary).

This FEAT is the *orchestrator* of the teacher-directed insurance-policy action.
It is deliberately thin on economics: it does NOT reimplement the Economic Engine
and it does NOT persist definition rows itself. Its whole job is to decide
**lawfulness** and then coordinate the write:

    Teacher submission
        → FEAT-CLASS-003 resolves canonical class/teacher context
        → asks the Economic Engine for recommendation metadata (advisory only)
        → validates ONLY actual contract legality (hard bounds + per-type
          structural subset), allowing values outside recommended ranges
        → delegates the immutable definition write to FEAT-POL-001
        → returns the fresh ``policy_uuid`` row.

Three-layer separation (authority):
- Economic Engine (SPEC-ECON-003): computes recommendations / derived
  consequences / exposes hard bounds. Advisory; enforces nothing at write time.
- FEAT-CLASS-003 (this module, DOM-CLASS spec §VII): decides lawfulness. Allows
  out-of-recommendation-range teacher values; rejects hard-bound and
  type-structure violations; coordinates the write. SHALL NOT mutate policy
  definitions directly — it invokes the POL definition commands within its own
  single FEAT context.
- POL definition commands (``insurance_definition_service.create_insurance_definition``
  / ``set_availability``): persist the already-lawful immutable definition; do not
  reinterpret it. (No FEAT-POL-001 executor exists — a FEAT never executes another
  FEAT; it composes domain commands.)

Immutability (DOM-POL-001): ``policy_uuid`` IS the version. "New" and "edit" both
produce a *fresh* ``policy_uuid`` row; a prior definition is never mutated in place.
Only the availability projection (IN_USE / HIDDEN / RETIRED) may change on an
existing row, via ``set_insurance_definition_availability``.

This module writes NOTHING to ``PolicyVersion`` / ``PolicyTransition`` — that
DOM-CLASS-003 *economic* version-control residue is not the insurance definition
store. There is no fallback to it.
