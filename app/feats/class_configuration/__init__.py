"""
Class Configuration FEATs — Phase 4 Mutation Boundary (SOP-DEV-002)

These FEATs orchestrate canonical class configuration mutations per DOM-CLASS-001/002:
- FEAT-CLASS-001: Create class boundary (immutable class + initial economic engine)
- FEAT-CLASS-002: Modify class boundary (roster modifications within existing class)
- FEAT-CLASS-003: Insurance policy management (orchestrates FEAT-POL-001 definition writes)
- FEAT-CLASS-004: Feature enablement/disablement (append-only class_features timeline)
- FEAT-CLASS-005: Economic engine evolution (immutable versioned policy transitions)
- FEAT-CLASS-006: Destroy class boundary (counterpart of 001, not a mode of it;
  envelope lives in app/routes/admin.py::_hard_delete_class_scope)

All FEATs enforce:
- CanonicalContext (user_id, class_id, seat_id, actor_role=teacher)
- Idempotency via natural primary key tuples
- SPEC-TIME-001 canonical temporal resolution
- INV-ARC-016 audit lineage (soft deletion)
