"""
Bill-cycle genesis — INTERIM, insurance purchase only.

DOM-OBL-001 v3.1 §V.7 has no separate genesis command: the first cycle is created
by ``schedule_next_bill_cycle`` succeeding an empty lineage, and rent already does
so. This module survives only because insurance purchase
(``purchase_insurance_feat``) still calls it. Insurance stays on this path until
its recurring-premium lifecycle is ratified and its lineage is keyed by
``entitlement_id`` (docs/TRACKING/PRODUCTION_READINESS_2026-09.md, "insurance has
no recurring-premium executor"); then insurance moves to succession and this
module is deleted. Do not add callers.

`cycle_number` is NOT caller-selected here — genesis inherently produces cycle 1.
The precondition is that no prior cycle exists for the lineage; a second genesis
attempt fails (BillCycleLifecycleError) regardless of idempotency key, because
idempotency protects retries of a command, it does not license a second cycle 1.

This is a domain command, not a user-facing FEAT: it carries no FEAT-registry
number of its own. It executes under the shared bill-cycle mutation-authority tag
`FEAT-OBL-002` (the same coarse authority under which rent reconciliation and
succession run).
