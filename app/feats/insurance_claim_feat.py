"""
FEAT-STOR-003: Insurance Claim Lifecycle (v2.0)

Orchestrates the complete insurance claim lifecycle on the first-class
``InsuranceClaim`` entity (DOM-STORE-001):

- Submission: resolve the immutable insurance policy governing the entitlement,
  create/idempotently return an ``InsuranceClaim(status=SUBMITTED)``. The
  entitlement is NOT consumed.
- Resolution: teacher adjudication transitions the claim SUBMITTED → APPROVED /
  REJECTED. Approval coordinates exactly one compensatory Ledger effect.

Lifecycle authority lives on ``InsuranceClaim``, never on an ``EntitlementEvent``:
filing or deciding a claim does NOT write a ``CONSUMED`` event. The insurance
entitlement stays ``GRANTED`` until its real coverage boundary, so multiple claims
may be filed under one active policy. Terminal claim decisions are immutable, and
at most one claim lifecycle may back a given source transaction.

Claim eligibility and economics come from the **immutable insurance policy**
(``insurance_policies``), resolved via the GRANTED entitlement's ``policy_uuid``
(``_resolve_claim_policy``). Because a policy edit produces a *new* ``policy_uuid``,
the exact row referenced by the entitlement is the frozen contract — there is no
separate snapshot. The entitlement proves acquisition; the policy provides the
terms (INV-ARC-009). No claim runtime reads any copied ``frozen_contract`` payload.

    Resource 1 (date-count allowance): the number of *distinct class-local dates*
    that may be claimed in the period is
    ``ceil(policy_terms.claimable_dates_per_week_equivalent × week_equivalent)``. The
    metered unit for PRODUCTIVITY is the DATE, not the claim case. Already-claimed
    distinct dates (any status, from immutable child-row history) plus the new
    dates must not exceed the allowance.

    Resource 2 (period payout capacity): ``premium × payout_multiple`` minus the Σ
    of persisted ``recognized_payout``; zero remaining fails the submission.

    ``expected_weekly_hours`` is **not** an authorization limit — it is economic
    normalization plus advisory guidance. This gate therefore never rejects a claim
    for exceeding it; instead it computes an *advisory* weekly-guidance flag set
    (derived, non-authoritative) that is surfaced to the student at submission and
    the teacher at review. The daily limit (when configured) remains a real hard
    boundary.

    Concurrent submissions serialize on the GRANTED row so two cannot both take the
    last date slot; the ``UNIQUE(entitlement_id, claim_date)`` constraint is the
    structural backstop.
