"""
FEAT-OBL-001: Rent Payment.

Completes a rent obligation for one seat/cycle atomically, coordinating three
domains under a single FEAT transaction (INV-ARC-021):

  1. Ledger    — post the rent principal debit (canonical write path).
  2. Obligations — record the immutable PAYMENT satisfaction event linked to
                   that ledger transaction (via FEAT-OBL-003).
  3. Store     — grant the RentSettings ``satisfaction_benefits`` PERK
                 entitlements (hall passes) carrying the obligation's
                 correlation_id, so they can later be EXPIRED at the rent
                 boundary by reconciliation.

Idempotency is COMMAND-owned: each payment command carries an ``idempotency_key``
that identifies the individual payment request. The ledger write is keyed by that
command key, and the PAYMENT satisfaction event dedupes on the resulting ledger
transaction. A replay of the SAME command neither re-charges nor re-grants — it
returns the prior outcome. Two DISTINCT commands against the same obligation are
two lawful PARTIAL payments that both persist under the one correlation
("one obligation → one correlation → many PAYMENT events"). Idempotency is never
inferred by counting prior payments. Either a command commits fully or not at all.

Amount semantics: the assessed rent amount is resolved from the upstream policy
via ``assessment.policy_uuid`` (DOM-OBL-001 §V.1). A command may satisfy the full
remaining principal (``payment_amount=None``) or, when RentSettings enables
``allow_incremental_payment``, a partial slice of it. Paid-to-date is the sum of
PAYMENT ledger magnitudes; the obligation is satisfied once that sum reaches the
assessed principal. Satisfaction PERKs are granted exactly once, on the command
that transitions the obligation from underpaid to fully paid.
