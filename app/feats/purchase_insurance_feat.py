"""
FEAT-OBL-004: Insurance Policy Purchase / Enrollment.

A student enters into (purchases) an insurance policy for the current class. The
user action is creating and immediately satisfying the FIRST premium obligation;
the INSURANCE entitlement grant is the consequence of successful satisfaction, not
the defining act — which is why this lives in the Obligations family, not Store.

Atomic success contract (one FEAT transaction; failure anywhere before commit
rolls back ALL of it, including the Ledger effect):

    resolve policy_uuid under class_id
      -> verify IN_USE
      -> reject same-policy concurrent coverage (POLICY_ALREADY_HELD)
      -> establish cycle-1 billing lineage (genesis) + record next boundary
      -> assess INSURANCE_PREMIUM for cycle 1
      -> satisfy it through the lawful Ledger path
      -> grant INSURANCE / PURCHASE entitlement (references policy_uuid; no snapshot)
      -> commit

policy_uuid IS the frozen contract: insurance_policies rows are immutable, so every
fact written here (assessment, entitlement, bill cycle) merely carries policy_uuid
and terms are retrieved later by resolving it. No terms are snapshotted.

Idempotency is COMMAND-owned. correlation_id embeds the idempotency_key, so a
replay of the SAME command is detected and returns the original result, while a
DIFFERENT command that finds active coverage for the same policy is rejected with
POLICY_ALREADY_HELD.
