"""
Bill-cycle termination — the Obligations command that STOPS a recurring lineage.

Succession and termination are the two bill-cycle operations (DOM-OBL-001 §V.7):

    succession:   nothing -> cycle 1, cycle N -> cycle N+1  (schedule_next_bill_cycle)
    termination:  cycle N -> cycle N+1*   (this module)  *terminal, no recurrence

Termination is cessation, not succession, so it does not route through
``schedule_next_bill_cycle``. (Insurance purchase still creates its cycle 1 through
the interim ``establish_bill_cycle`` until the insurance lineage migrates.)

A terminal cycle row carries ``next_assessment_at = NULL``: the lineage produces
no further recurring assessment (DOM-OBL-001 §160, §241). It does NOT rewrite
prior obligation events (DOM-OBL-001 §IX.7 / §293) — the historical cycles and
their assessments remain immutable. Coverage still runs to the current cycle's
``cycle_boundary_at``; ending the entitlement at that boundary is a separate,
Store-owned disposition (FEAT-STOR-002 EXPIRED), never performed here.

Insurance cancellation (FEAT-OBL-005) terminates the recurring
``INSURANCE_PREMIUM`` lineage through this command — stopping future premiums
without revoking, refunding, or early-expiring the paid coverage
(FEAT-STOR-002 §IX.C: insurance is non-revocable).

This is a domain command, not a user-facing FEAT: it carries no FEAT-registry
number of its own and executes under the shared bill-cycle mutation-authority tag
``FEAT-OBL-002`` (the same coarse authority as succession). The
termination distinction lives in the command contract, not the authority tag.

    Preconditions:
    - a current cycle exists for ``internal_ref`` (you cannot terminate a lineage
      that was never established — genesis is a separate command);
    - the current cycle belongs to ``class_id`` (scope integrity).

    Postconditions:
    - the latest cycle for the lineage is terminal (``next_assessment_at IS NULL``),
      so no further recurring assessment will be scheduled;
    - the terminal cycle's ``cycle_boundary_at`` is the prior cycle's
      ``next_assessment_at`` — the end of the period the last paid premium covers,
      i.e. the point at which (absent cancellation) the next premium would have
      fallen due. Coverage runs through that boundary and then expires
      (FEAT-STOR-002), and the policy identity is carried forward;
    - prior cycles and their assessment/satisfaction events are unchanged.

    Idempotency:
    - if the lineage is already terminal (latest cycle has ``next_assessment_at IS
      NULL``), the existing terminal cycle is returned unchanged — cancelling an
      already-cancelled lineage is a safe no-op.
