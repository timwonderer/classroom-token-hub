"""FEAT-PROD-004 — Complete Payroll Cycle orchestration (DOM-PROD-001 §XV, slice 8.3d).

The canonical class-level payroll-run orchestrator and the sole coordination point
for the economic-cycle boundary. It owns nothing but sequencing and atomicity: every
substantive operation underneath it is a separately-certified substrate command.

    complete_payroll_cycle(...)
        1. resolve_completed_run   ── found → RETURN existing payroll_cycle_id (STOP)
        2. allocate_payroll_cycle_id
        3. settle_class_payroll_cycle           (PROD)
        4. compute_partial_payload              (ITR compute — complete 17/17)
        5. materialize_interpretation_cycle     (ITR — one immutable record)
        6. apply_next_boundary_transition       (CLASS — activate next-cycle policy)
        7. record_run_completion                (replay anchor)
        —— caller's FEATContext commits once ——

Two orderings are held as hard invariants:

* **The replay guard is literally first.** A completed replay resolves the
  completion anchor and returns; it does NOT allocate a cycle id, settle, compute a
  timestamp, capture reference_configuration, or invoke ITR/CLASS. This protects the
  seam 8.2c exposed: a replay never recaptures an advanced configuration.
* **record_run_completion is literally last before commit.** The completion row
  means "this entire economic-cycle transition completed", so if anything before it
  fails, no completion identity survives — the whole run rolls back with the
  caller's transaction.

This function does NOT commit; it runs inside the caller's ``FEATContext``
("FEAT-PROD-004"), which owns the single commit and the fail-closed rollback. It
performs no scheduling and no boundary derivation — the lawful cycle window is
supplied by the caller (PROD/orchestration establishes boundary legality,
DOM-CLASS-003). It never calls a domain directly for anything a substrate command
already owns.
