    """Null support-domain references to ledger rows that are about to be deleted.

    ``issues.related_transaction_id`` and
    ``issue_resolution_actions.related_transaction_id`` are real foreign keys with
    ``ON DELETE NO ACTION``, and ``issues`` carries no class or seat scope of its own,
    so those rows do not cascade away with the seat. Without this sweep the delete
    aborts on a live FK reference.

    **What this deliberately does not touch.** The ledger's own
    ``original_transaction_id`` / ``reversal_transaction_id`` self-references are
    *not* swept, for two independent reasons:

    1. They are not FK-enforced (no constraint on ``ledger_transaction`` references
       either column), so nothing about the delete requires them to be cleared.
    2. A reversal pair can never span economic owners. Both policy writers bind the
       link to a single ``seat_id``: ``ledger_correction_service.reverse_transaction``
       copies ``seat_id``/``class_id``/``target_seat_id`` from the original into the
       reversal (only ``actor_seat_id``, a provenance column, may differ), and the
       insurance-reimbursement path in ``insurance_claim_feat`` writes
       ``seat_id=student_seat.id`` behind
       ``insurance_eligibility_contract``'s ``transaction.seat_id != covered_seat_id``
       rejection. Every other writer merely forwards a caller-supplied value.

    So lawful seat deletion removes *both* ends of the pair in the same cascade;
    a surviving row pointing at a deleted row is not a reachable state. Clearing
    these columns would therefore rewrite a surviving financial fact, which
    DOM-LED-001 §VII.2 forbids and the ``ledger_transaction_no_rewrite`` trigger
    rejects outright.
