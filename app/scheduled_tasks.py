    Automatic payroll is merely a second *initiation mechanism* for the same
    economic-cycle completion as manual payroll (DOM-PROD-001 §XV). This job owns
    exactly one question — "is this class due for automatic payroll now?" — and
    then becomes just another caller of ``complete_payroll_cycle``. It contains no
    payroll, interpretation, or activation logic of its own.

    A class is due when its active ``PayrollSettings`` carries a
    ``next_payroll_date`` at or before now. The **scheduled occurrence** (that
    ``next_payroll_date``) is the deterministic command identity: every retry of
    the same occurrence derives the same idempotency key, while the next intended
    occurrence — after ``next_payroll_date`` advances — derives a different one. So
    the ``payroll_cycle_completion`` anchor makes scheduler retries idempotent
    without any bespoke job-run substrate. Each class runs under its OWN top-level
    FEAT transaction (a plain loop, no shared FEAT context), so one class's failure
    cannot roll back or block another; the ``next_payroll_date`` advance commits
    atomically with the cycle so a failed run stays due under the same key.

    §1). Coverage stops renewing when its recurring premium lineage is terminated
    (a terminal ``bill_cycles`` row with ``next_assessment_at IS NULL`` — via
    FEAT-OBL-005 cancellation, teacher offering-cancel, or nonpayment non-renewal;
    DOM-OBL-001 §160/§241). This job is the Store-owned boundary trigger: it reads
    the bill-cycle table directly for terminal insurance lineages whose
    ``cycle_boundary_at`` has been reached and writes EXPIRED for the matching
    coverage through the FEAT-STOR-002 domain command.

    The work-list is the table itself — terminal rows past boundary — so there is no
    per-entitlement enumeration and no lag: a lineage becomes due the day its
    boundary arrives. Each expiry runs under its OWN top-level FEAT-STOR-002 context
    (isolated failure), and ``expire_entitlement`` is idempotent (an already-EXPIRED
    lineage is a no-op), so re-runs are safe.
