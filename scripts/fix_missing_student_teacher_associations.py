"""
Fix missing StudentTeacher associations.

This script creates StudentTeacher records for any students that have a teacher_id
but no corresponding StudentTeacher association. This fixes legacy students that
were created before the multi-tenancy system was fully implemented.

Run this script BEFORE deploying the security fix that removes teacher_id filtering
from get_admin_student_query().

Usage:
    python scripts/fix_missing_student_teacher_associations.py
