"""
Migrate legacy students to the new association system.

This script:
1. Finds all legacy students (have teacher_id but no StudentTeacher record)
2. Creates StudentTeacher many-to-many associations
3. Creates TeacherBlock entries (marked as claimed) for each legacy student
4. Generates stable join codes per teacher-block combination

USAGE:
    python3 scripts/migrate_legacy_students.py

NOTE: Run this script from the project root directory.
      Requires environment variables to be set (DATABASE_URL, etc.)

WHAT IT DOES:
    1. Finds all students with teacher_id set but missing StudentTeacher records
    2. Creates StudentTeacher(student_id, admin_id) for each legacy student
    3. Creates TeacherBlock entries marked as claimed, using existing student credentials
    4. Groups students by (teacher_id, block) and assigns shared join codes
    5. Commits changes to database
