"""
Cleanup duplicate students using Flask shell.
This script uses the existing Flask database connection from your app config.

IMPORTANT: This script migrates all related records (transactions, tap events, etc.)
from duplicate students to the student being kept, then deletes duplicates.

Usage:
    python scripts/cleanup_duplicates_flask.py --list     # Show duplicates
    python scripts/cleanup_duplicates_flask.py --delete   # Delete duplicates (with migration)

Note: Must be run from the repository root directory.
