"""End-to-end Rent lifecycle tests (canonical entitlement path).

Covers the corrected rent architecture:

  RentSettings (schedule intent)
    -> rent_schedule_service (class-local date arithmetic)
    -> canonical temporal resolver (class-local-date -> UTC materialization only)
    -> BillCycle (resolved concrete instants, materialized ONCE)
    -> reconcile_rent (FEAT-OBL-002, instant comparison, idempotent)
    -> rent_payment_feat (FEAT-OBL-001, Ledger + PAYMENT + PERK grant atomically)

Key invariants asserted:
  - Reconciliation creates cycle 1 + one RENT ASSESSMENT per claimed student,
    idempotently (re-run is a NOOP producing no duplicates).
  - A later RentSettings change does NOT retroactively move an already
    materialized cycle's three boundaries (INV-CORE-000 non-retroactivity).
  - Catch-up advances to cycle 2 and expires the prior cycle's PERK hall passes
    at the rent boundary.
  - rent_payment_feat posts the ledger debit, records the PAYMENT event, and
    grants the configured PERK hall passes; replay is idempotent; and it refuses
    to overdraft (INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS).

Uses the canonical test initializer (SPEC-TEST-001) and injects
``reference_time_utc`` rather than reading any wall clock (SPEC-TIME-001).
