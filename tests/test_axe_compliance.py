"""Rendered axe-core smoke audits for the public application surface.

This audit drives a real browser against a RUNNING dev server, so it has three
environment prerequisites: the Playwright package, a Chromium build, and a
server listening on ``BASE_URL``. It is not part of the accessibility CI gate
(``.github/workflows/accessibility-gate.yml`` runs ``tests/test_accessibility.py``),
so in an ordinary suite run the server is normally absent.

All three prerequisites are therefore treated alike and skip rather than fail.
Previously the first two skipped and the third raised ``ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED``,
which put a permanent red in every full-suite run — noise that makes a real
regression harder to see. A skip says "not audited here"; a failure should be
reserved for "audited, and the page has a violation".

To actually run it: ``flask run`` in another shell, then invoke pytest.
