"""Hall-pass policy definitions are immutable and append-only (DOM-POL-001 §VI).

Regression coverage for the ``HallPassSettings`` half of blocker **B2**.

This writer already inserted a new row per save, so the append-only half looked
done. What was missing was supersession: nothing retired the predecessor, so a
class accumulated several rows all claiming to be current and the reader picked
one by sort order.

A second gap sat in ``_get_or_create_hall_pass_settings``, which inserted a
default policy as a side effect of being *asked* which policy applied. That is
not an INV-ARC-007 GET-write — its only live caller was the queue-settings
write command — but it did mint a governing contract nobody submitted, and it
left that conjured row unretired alongside the submission that followed it.
