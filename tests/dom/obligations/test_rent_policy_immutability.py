"""Rent policy definitions are immutable and append-only (DOM-POL-001 §VI.0/§VI.1).

Regression coverage for blocker **B1**.

``ObligationAssessment`` has no amount column. The amount a student owes for a
cycle is resolved at read time from the ``rent_settings`` row addressed by the
``policy_uuid`` the assessment froze at creation. That freeze was already wired
end to end — ``reconcile_rent`` stamps ``settings.policy_uuid`` onto every new
``BillCycle`` and every new ``ObligationAssessment``. It was inert, because
``rent_settings`` was a mutable singleton (``class_id`` was UNIQUE and the admin
handler reassigned fields on the fetched row). Rewriting the row rewrote what
every already-assessed historical cycle said the student owed.

These tests fail against the pre-fix commit: there, a rent change from 50 to 200
retroactively reprices cycle 1's closed assessment to 200.

The invariant under test, stated positively: *a rent submission is a new
contract, and the contracts already in force keep their terms.*
