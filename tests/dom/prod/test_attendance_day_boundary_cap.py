"""Regression: an unclosed `active` attendance session must not accrue time
across a day boundary.

DOM-PROD-001 §312: "Any ``active`` sessions SHALL automatically terminate by end
of day at canonical class timezone with the ``reason_code = done_for_day``.
Timestamp for the ``inactive`` entry SHALL be recorded using the same date as the
originating ``active`` entry."

The old ``_calculate_attendance_seconds_since`` extended any trailing open
``active`` interval to ``current_time_utc`` unconditionally. A student who tapped
in and never tapped out would keep accruing payable seconds overnight and across
subsequent days -- so a payroll run the next day paid for hours the student was
never present. The fix caps the open interval at the end-of-day boundary of the
canonical class-local day on which the ``active`` entry was recorded.
