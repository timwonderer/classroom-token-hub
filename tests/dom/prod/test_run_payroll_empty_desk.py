"""Regression: /admin/run_payroll must survive an empty desk in the roster.

Reproduces the live-browser defect where a class contained one claimed,
attended student seat (done-for-day, so payroll has earnings to pay) PLUS one
empty desk -- an unclaimed roster seat with ``user_id IS NULL`` and
``role='student'``.

The old ``_run_payroll`` iterated *every* ``role='student'`` seat, including the
empty desk. ``record_payroll_event`` then tried to persist a ``PayrollEvent``
with ``target_user_id = seat.user_id`` (NULL), violating the NOT NULL column and
rolling back the *entire* batch -- so the attended student was never paid and the
teacher saw "Database error during payroll".

The fix keys payroll population off the ATTENDANCE RECORD
(``AttendanceSession.target_seat_id``) rather than the seat roster. Empty desks
have no attendance rows and are excluded by construction; any seat that *does*
have attendance is necessarily a claimed participant (attendance is seat+user
anchored). This mirrors DOM-IDEN-001: activity keys off seat_id.
