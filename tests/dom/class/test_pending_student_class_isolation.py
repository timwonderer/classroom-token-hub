"""Same-teacher/two-class isolation regression tests for pending-student deletion.

Guards the P0 class-isolation invariant on the repaired
``bulk_delete_pending_students`` admin route: the operation must act on exactly
the single active canonical class (``g.canonical_context.class_id``) and must
never reach a sibling class owned by the same teacher.

``chemistry_p1`` and ``ap_csp_p3`` are both owned by ``teacher_alice`` in the
canonical fixtures, so provisioning both yields one teacher owning two classes —
the precise scenario a class-isolation violation would leak across.
