"""Void/reversal obligation-finality guard (SPEC-OPS-001 §VII, INV-OPS-008).

Obligation-related monetary transactions are neither voidable nor reversible.
The canonical void/reversal boundary (FEAT-LED-002, _execute_void_transaction_impl)
must reject them by provenance BEFORE any compensating transaction is created, and
must not resurrect the removed legacy rent-payment reversal path (INV-OPS-012).

Non-obligation transactions must still follow the ordinary lawful void path.
