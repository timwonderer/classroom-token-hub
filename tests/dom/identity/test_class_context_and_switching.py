"""Identity domain Phase 8 verification: context processor view models and class switching.

Tests that the production context processors inject StudentLayoutContextView into
real HTTP responses, and that the class switching API route works correctly.

All tests use SPEC-TEST-001 canonical initializer. No synthetic context processor
invocations — every assertion is against a real HTTP response produced by production code.

Multi-class fixtures follow SPEC-TEST-001 §VIII: initialize() for base classroom,
provision_classroom() for additional classes, _provision_roster_seat() for proper
seat construction with IdentityProfile and claim hashes.

    #
    #   1. Resolution must fail closed, full stop. INV-ARC-008 §V: requests "MUST
    #      resolve to exactly one `seat_id` within exactly one active `class_id`, or
    #      fail closed." INV-ARC-001 §V *permits* `user_id` -> `seat_id` lookup within
    #      a supplied `class_id`, but permission is not obligation: it licenses a
    #      mechanism, it does not mandate recovering scope when canonical seat context
    #      is absent. Reading it as a recovery mandate would put it in direct conflict
    #      with INV-ARC-008's no-fallback rule, which forbids resolving to another seat
    #      owned by the same user.
    #
    #   2. This fixture's end state is itself constitutionally invalid, so it cannot
    #      establish required production behavior. INV-CORE-000 §III.6 requires that a
    #      user with no remaining seat associations "MUST be deleted from the system
    #      entirely," and expressly prohibits "retaining seat or user records after
    #      their last `class_id` association is removed." INV-ARC-013 says the same
    #      from the access side: membership is the existence of a valid class
    #      association, not residual account state. A seatless `users` row is a state
    #      the constitution says cannot exist.
    #
    # So pinning one intermediate hop would pin an implementation detail of an
    # unreachable state. Follow the chain and assert only what canon actually
    # guarantees: that it comes to rest closed.
