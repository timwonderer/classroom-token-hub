"""A transfer is lateral movement, not spending — insufficient funds is invalid.

A transfer between the seat's OWN accounts (checking<->savings) is not a failed
agreement. On insufficient funds it must simply decline: it does NOT proceed and
does NOT incur an NSF fee. NSF is charged only where money was meant to leave for
a purchase or to meet an obligation. Regression for the checking-insufficient
transfer branch, which previously charged a forced overdraft fee.
