"""NSF fee is recorded as an immediate fine obligation, by the business FEAT.

An NSF/overdraft fee is a FINE (SPEC-ECON-003); per DOM-OBL-001 §II.C an
immediately-collected charge is still an obligation; and per DOM-LED-001 §II the
Ledger stays domain-blind — the fine's Economic Context is Obligations-owned.
So the ORIGINATING BUSINESS FEAT, after Ledger posts the fee debit, records an
NSF_FEE obligation (ASSESSMENT + PAYMENT settled by that debit) via
``record_nsf_fee_obligation`` from within its own committing FEAT context.

These tests exercise that orchestrator directly (the unit the business FEATs
call), driving it inside a committing FEAT context exactly as store-purchase /
admin-adjustment do.
