Tests for join code persistence in legacy classes.

This test verifies that when a teacher has students from before the join code
system was implemented (i.e., students exist but no TeacherBlock entries),
the join codes generated for those blocks persist across page loads.

Regression test for: "Join code for legacy classes does not persist"
