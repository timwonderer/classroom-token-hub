CLASS Phase 2 Persistence Tests

Verifies the persistence-layer invariants of the versioned economic engine and the
append-only class_features timeline per DOM-CLASS-001 / DOM-CLASS-002 authority:

  1. Exactly one EconomicEngine root per class (previous_version_id IS NULL).
  2. Historical versions are immutable (no in-place UPDATE).
  3. previous_version_id lineage stays within the owning class.
  4. Referenced versions cannot be deleted (RESTRICT / append-only enforcement).
  5. class_features is an append-only history.
  6. Effective-version resolution returns the latest enabled row per feature.
  7. In-place mutation / deletion of historical rows is prohibited.

Rewrite note (Priority A, 2026-08-23)
-------------------------------------
These tests were previously module-skipped because they mutated state via direct
`db.session.add`/`commit` on domain models, which v2 FEAT-INTEGRITY enforcement
(app/feats/base.py) now blocks outside a verified FEAT context.

The invariants split into two categories, tested through two lawful mechanisms:

* Valid-state / behavioral invariants (1, 3, 5, 6) are established through the
  CANONICAL PRODUCERS: the ClassEconomy after_insert listener seeds the single
  root engine + default 'payroll' feature; FEAT-CLASS-004 enables/disables
  features; FEAT-CLASS-005 evolves the engine into new immutable versions. No
  direct ORM mutation of domain models occurs.

* Persistence-ENFORCEMENT invariants (2, 4, 7 + CHECK/PK constraints) test that
  the DATABASE rejects illegal states. Canonical producers cannot exercise these
  — they validate inputs and never emit illegal rows. The only faithful way to
  probe the persistence boundary is to issue raw SQL through
  `db.session.execute(text(...))`. Raw SQL does not populate
  session.new/dirty/deleted, so it is NOT the ORM-object mutation that
  FEAT-INTEGRITY guards; it reaches the DB boundary directly, which is exactly
  what a persistence-constraint test must do. Assertions are unchanged in
  strength — illegal writes must still raise.

Phase 2d immutability triggers (economic_engine_no_update/no_delete,
class_features_no_update/no_delete) are present on the test database and raise
`InternalError` ("... immutable ...") on any UPDATE/DELETE. They are unconditional
and therefore SUBSUME the RESTRICT foreign keys: no historical row can be deleted
at all. Tests for deletion-prevention assert the block and note that the trigger
is the proximate enforcer with RESTRICT as defense-in-depth.

Class hard-deletion vs. append-only history (see the two cascade tests):
EconomicEngine.class_id and ClassFeature.class_id declare `ondelete='CASCADE'`.
The append-only no_delete triggers are NOT an absolute bar — they yield to the
sanctioned session flag `cth.class_universe_destroying='on'`, which the canonical
hard-deletion path `_hard_delete_class_scope` (app/routes/admin.py) sets via
`SET LOCAL` before deleting the `classes` row. A naive `DELETE FROM classes`
(without the flag) is correctly blocked; the canonical boundary permits the
cascade. The cascade tests drive that canonical flag+delete boundary and assert
the owned engine/feature history is physically removed.

Per SPEC-TEST-001: classroom state is provisioned via the canonical initializer.
Per SPEC-TIME-001: temporal values come from canonical_temporal_resolver.
