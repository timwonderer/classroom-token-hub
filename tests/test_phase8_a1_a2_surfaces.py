Phase 8 - A1 & A2 Surface Verification

Tests that verify:
- A1: Student Rent surface (GET /student/rent) renders correctly with canonical obligations schema
- A2: Admin Rent Settings surface (GET|POST /admin/rent-settings) functions correctly

Both tests verify:
- Routes use event_type discriminator (ASSESSMENT, PAYMENT, WAIVED per DOM-OBL-001)
- Amounts are read from Ledger (DOM-LED-001), not stored in obligations
- Multi-tenancy scoping by class_id is enforced
