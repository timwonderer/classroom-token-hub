## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Canonical auth and roster-provisioning docs aligned** — Updated active v2
  identity, recovery, lifecycle, schema, session, README, and development docs so
  `User` owns authentication/recovery/passkey capability, `Seat` owns class-local
  actor authority and claim hashes, `IdentityProfile` remains display-only, and
  roster upload is documented as provisioning an inactive participant position
  rather than creating a student. Added `V2_CANONICAL_AUTH_RUNTIME_CUTOVER.md` to
  separate current bridge implementation facts from constitutional target docs, then
  updated the active migration tracker, development docs index, authority extraction
  plan, and Wave 3 risk doc to stop presenting pre-cutover v1 auth as current
  runtime guidance. Refreshed active teacher/student user guides that still described
  DOB-based claim or recovery flows.
- **Canonical identity foundation schema added** — Expanded `users` with unified
  auth, credential, session, role, and last-active-seat fields; added seat-owned
  claim verification hashes; made `identity_profiles` seat-bindable; and completed
  lifecycle fields for `user_invite_tokens` and `user_recovery_tokens`. Migration
  `a6d9c2e4f1b7` is additive and intentionally does not infer canonical bindings
  from deprecated `Student`, `Admin`, `TeacherBlock`, or class teacher ownership.
- **Fresh canonical database rebuild path repaired** — Hardened squash-era
  migrations that assumed historical `classes`, `transaction`, `users.username`,
  or `users.last_active_class_id` shapes even though `0001_bootstrap.py` creates
  live runtime metadata. The canonical seed no longer calls `db.create_all()` and
  now provisions canonical user, seat, seat-bound profile, and unclaimed-seat
  claim state before adding explicit legacy compatibility shadows.
- **Canonical identity principal backfill added** — Migration `b7e4c1d9a2f6`
  deterministically migrates credentialed legacy principals into `users`,
  normalizes existing bound-seat claim state, creates teacher seats for
  credentialed teachers' classes, and binds student display profiles to seats.
  The migration fails on username, role, or seat-binding ambiguity and does not
  derive authority from `TeacherBlock`. Successful login sessions now populate
  canonical `user_id` when a migrated user exists, and deprecated user-session
  aliases are no longer read or written.
- **Canonical User credential login activated for TOTP and PIN flows** — Teacher,
  student, and system-admin login now resolve and verify credentials from `users`
  before resolving deprecated principal rows as route compatibility shadows.
  Student claim/setup, teacher signup/reset, system-admin provisioning, and
  student recovery now keep canonical credentials synchronized; legacy-only
  principals and missing canonical recovery identities fail closed. Passkey
  external IDs remain a separate legacy-backed cutover.
- **Passkey credential ownership moved to canonical users** — Added migration
  `c8f1e2d3a4b5` to store canonical `user_id` owners on teacher and system-admin
  passkey metadata, backfill existing credentials, and fail closed on unmapped
  rows. Passwordless registration/authentication now uses `user_<User.id>`
  external IDs; legacy `admin_<id>` and `sysadmin_<id>` passkey principals are
  rejected.
- **Auth resolvers now require canonical user identity** — `get_current_admin()`,
  `get_current_system_admin()`, and `get_logged_in_student()` now resolve the
  canonical `User` first and only then hydrate deprecated `Admin`, `SystemAdmin`,
  or `Student` route shadows. Raw legacy session IDs alone no longer establish
  resolver identity.
- **Ledger Identity Severance Completed (Wave 5 / Phase 1C)** — Formally decommissioned `student_id` from the canonical ledger tables (`ledger_transaction` and `ledger_balance_snapshot`). All balances and financial histories are now strictly derived via `seat_id` + `class_id` joints. `Student.transactions` backrefs were replaced with explicit seat-proxied properties. `db.session.in_nested_transaction` support was formalized in the FEAT orchestrator to allow savepoints within top-level atomic feats without violating authority isolation.
- **Support issue actor reference now uses canonical public actor naming** — Support
  issue rows now expose the filing seat's UUID `Seat.public_id` as
  `issues.actor_public_id`, matching the same actor-public identity language as TLCP.
- **TLCP support correlation now uses seat public IDs at runtime** — Request traces,
  error events, support-ticket correlation packs, and student recent-error prompts now
  use the active class-scoped `Seat.public_id` value instead of generating a separate
  student-wide actor marker. Physical TLCP columns, indexes, log labels, tests, and
  sysadmin copy affordances now use `actor_public_id`.
- **Class-scoped teacher public lookups now use teacher-seat UUIDs** — New class anchors provision a teacher `Seat`, `/api/hall-pass/verification/active` now requires one explicit `class_id` plus that teacher seat's UUID `public_id`, and the obsolete `/student/switch-teacher/<teacher_public_id>` route now returns `404`. Hall-pass pass-type lookup rejects `teacher_public_id` input, and explicit invalid `join_code` aliases now fail closed instead of falling back to another claimed seat.
- **Seat public identity formalized as one UUID family** — Added the normative v2 identity ownership model: `users.id` authenticates, `seats.id` acts, `classes.class_id` scopes, and UUID-encoded `seats.public_id` is the single deidentified public actor identifier for both teacher and student seats. Role-specific public-ID fields and separate TLCP actor identity families are now classified as invalid v2 residue rather than supported identity alternatives.
- **Class-period metadata is being formalized as `section` on `classes`** — The v2 architecture docs now explicitly define `section` as the canonical metadata field for labels such as `2`, `Block A`, and `Period 1`, while `display_name` remains the human-facing class title such as `Honors Chemistry`. Remaining `block` fields are transitional naming debt and should not be treated as canonical identity or authority.
- **Teacher student-detail URLs now expose class-local seat public IDs only** — Numeric `/admin/students/<student_id>` detail URLs now return `404`. Teacher-facing student-detail links use signed, short-lived navigation URLs carrying `seats.public_id`, and route resolution requires the seat public ID, signed token class, teacher ownership, and active `current_class_id` to identify the same seat. This prevents cross-class seat selection for shared students, including when one teacher owns both classes.
- **Class-scoped feature authority and disabled-route behavior tightened** — Admin feature pages now enforce class-scoped feature toggles as the sole authority and render a dedicated disabled page with a direct link to feature settings; student feature-gated routes now return hard `404` when disabled. Feature settings UI is now per-period only.
- **Runtime settings normalization toward `class_id` authority** — Payroll, analytics, student banking settings, rebalance activation, and admin settings cleanup paths were updated to resolve class scope and query settings rows by `class_id`, reducing reliance on teacher/global settings reads in active runtime paths.
- **Class-scoped test fixtures aligned with clean-break semantics** — Rent waiver tests now seed canonical `RentSettings` scope (`class_id` + `join_code`) to match runtime authority.
- **Wave 2 bootstrap migration squash started** - Archived 196 legacy Alembic revisions into `migrations/archive/v1_196_migrations/`, introduced `migrations/versions/0001_bootstrap.py` as the new baseline head (`down_revision = None`) to idempotently co-create legacy and canonical tables, and added `scripts/verify_migration_squash.py` to assert head/table expectations.
- **V2 money authority model closed** — Student, admin, sysadmin, and redemption money paths now funnel through FEAT/domain services into `ledger_service`, with `Transaction(` construction restricted to `app/services/ledger_service.py` and enforced by structural guardrails.
- **Admin-side authority extraction completed for money workflows** — Payroll runs, manual payroll adjustments, bonus/fine flows, insurance claim reimbursement, transaction void, and bug-reward issuance no longer create money rows inline in route handlers.
- **Transfer zero-sum invariant is now explicit** — Added a class-scoped critical smoke test proving canonical transfer pairs net to zero within a `join_code` boundary and remain isolated from transfer activity in other class scopes.
- **District assurance brief page and trust-link rollout** — Added the district-facing `/district-assurance` page and linked it from privacy and authentication-related templates so the v2 branch exposes the current data-protection summary across key entry points.
- **Foundational v2 architecture corpus expanded** — Added execution-model, core-invariant, and capability-architecture foundation documents plus parked realignment drafts so the branch carries a clearer written baseline for the ongoing rebuild.
- **Architecture invariants now capture rebuild intent and downstream consequences** — Expanded each v2 architecture invariant with explicit "Rebuild Intent" and "Downstream Consequence" sections to formalize which migration constraints future work must preserve.
- **Collective goal reactivation strict scoping** — Added deterministic UUID-based instance mapping for collective goals using `collective_goal_instance_code` across `StoreItem` and `StudentItem` ensuring robust reactivation progress tracking preventing bleed across past purchase states. Replaced lazy overlaps with direct DB inner join references.
- **v2 launch-readiness checklist reconciled with current docs state** — Updated the readiness matrix, launch project checklist, reconciliation tracker, README, and documentation SOP references so branch-local launch planning stays aligned with the latest branch status.
- **v2.0 launch-readiness and rehearsal documentation finalized** — Refreshed the v2 tracking artifacts, rehearsal checklist, and final live-test report so `codex/v2.0` reflects the current branch state, readiness blockers, and production transition guidance.
- **Class-scoped admin and student onboarding workflow expansion** — Added join-code and class-ID aware admin context handling for student addition, store management, and rent item sync, then extended student claiming and class-membership flows to preserve class scope during teacher-managed onboarding.
- **Attendance, migration validation, and test date handling tightened** — Aligned attendance calculations and tests around timezone-consistent date handling, expanded migration upgrade/downgrade validation checks, and updated attendance status handling to recognize the "done for the day" completion path.
- **v2.0 live-test candidate documentation refresh** - Updated the living engineering docs to reflect the consolidated v2 branch, current PostgreSQL test evidence (`708 passed, 1 skipped`), resolved migration heads, and the v2 authority model where `ClassEconomy` and `ClassMembership` define class scope. Added explicit live-test and production transition runbooks, refreshed architecture/API/schema references, and updated user guides that previously implied numeric teacher IDs, teacher-global class behavior, or legacy fallback semantics.
- **ClassEconomy and ClassMembership data-integrity hardening** — Added SQLAlchemy `Enum` types for `ClassEconomy.status` (active, archived), `ClassMembership.role` (admin, student), and `ClassMembership.status` (active, archived). Aligned the membership XOR check constraint name with existing DB constraints and added migration `a11213ca4afb` to normalize invalid values and enforce strict DB check constraints for class economy status, membership status, and membership role consistency. (Addresses PR #1078 review comments)

### Fixed
- **Test database reset stability for v2 Postgres runs** — Improved the test reset path by disposing pooled connections before rebuilding the database state, reducing failures caused by lingering connections during repeated v2 test runs.
- **DB-level student ownership invariant enforcement** — Added migration `1adc6456ab0e` with deferrable PostgreSQL constraint triggers that reject commits where any `students` row exists without at least one `student_teachers` link. This hardens the "no global/orphan student state" rule at the database layer during join-code/class deletion workflows.
- **Student account claim failure when teachers upload roster with same name twice** — Fixed `_sync_identity_profile()` which was skipping `IdentityProfile` creation when `first_name` or `last_initial` was empty, leaving `identity_id` as NULL. This caused `TeacherBlock` inserts to fail with a NOT NULL constraint violation. Now uses placeholder values `"[Unknown]"` and `"?"` if identity fields are missing, ensuring the profile is always created. By-product: When multiple roster uploads or manual adds target the same student, the claim flow now handles partial-state records gracefully. Cleaned up one limbo student (Student#2) that was linked to multiple unclaimed seats due to duplicate add attempts.
- **Test: Removed false positive assertion for non-existent sysadmin teacher deletion** — The test `test_manage_teachers_hides_delete_actions` was asserting that "Teacher-managed" text appears in the sysadmin manage-teachers template, but this text doesn't exist. The assertion was removed since the actual intent of the test (verifying delete URLs are NOT present) is already correctly validated.
- **Foreign key violation when adding individual students** — Fixed `IntegrityError` in `add_individual_student` and `_link_student_to_admin` where `TeacherBlock` records were created without first ensuring the parent `ClassEconomy` record exists. Both functions now call `_ensure_join_code_anchors` before creating `TeacherBlock` records to satisfy the `fk_teacher_blocks_join_code_class_economies` foreign key constraint.
- **Rent validation recommendation mismatch for block-scoped API checks** — Updated `EconomyBalanceChecker.validate_rent_value()` so block-scoped rent validation uses AGENTS monthly multipliers (`2.0x-2.5x`, default `2.25x`) while global validation continues to honor policy-mode weekly burden conversion. This resolves incorrect minimum recommendations (for example `$733.76` instead of `$562.50`) in `/admin/api/economy/validate/rent` for class-selected flows.
- **Pre-merge fix: Missing ClassEconomy and ClassMembership models** — Added `ClassEconomy` and `ClassMembership` SQLAlchemy models to `app/models.py` to match the `class_economies` and `class_memberships` tables created in prior migrations. These models were referenced in `app/utils/deletion.py`, multiple test files, and `tmp_admin.py` but were absent from the model layer, causing `ImportError` at startup.
- **Pre-merge fix: Stale `admin_id` column name in test fixtures** — Updated 58 test files (121 occurrences) to use `teacher_id` instead of `admin_id` when constructing or querying `StudentTeacher`, `DeletionRequest`, and `RecoveryRequest` records, after migration `c4e1a2b3d4f6` renamed those columns.
- **Economy analytics/report class-scoping hardening** — Removed teacher-global fallback behavior for selected-class analytics windows and economy API checks. `analytics.py`, `analytics_engine.py`, and admin economy APIs now resolve class settings with join-code-first precedence (join-code scoped rows first, then legacy block-scoped compatibility rows), instead of falling through to `block=None` teacher-global rows during class-selected flows.
- **Join-code strict scoping for hall-pass availability** — `/api/hall-pass/available-types` now supports `join_code` and `teacher_public_id` identity inputs and enforces active class scope for student sessions; legacy numeric `teacher_id` fallback was removed.
- **Join-code strict scoping for student settings lookups** — Student banking/rent/feature settings resolution now uses current class context (`teacher_id` + `join_code`, block-preferred) across transfer, interest, insurance purchase, shop rent checks, and rent payment flows. Direct teacher-only settings queries were removed from these routes.
- **Legacy numeric student teacher-switch route disabled** — `/student/switch-period/<int:teacher_id>` no longer mutates class context; students are redirected to use join-code/public-id based class switching only.
- **Broken help/guide links after doc system revamp** — Updated all doc path references in `layout_admin.html`, `layout_student.html`, `admin_insurance.html`, `admin_store.html`, and `admin_payroll.html` from hyphenated paths (e.g., `teacher-students`) to the new slash-separated directory structure (e.g., `teacher/students`).
- **Passkey "Never used" always displayed** — Passkeys are tracked in our database without a `credential_id` (credentials are managed on the Passwordless.dev servers). The auth-finish handler was looking up credentials by `credential_id` (which is always `NULL`), so `last_used` was never updated. Fixed by updating `last_used` on all credentials for the authenticated admin/sysadmin when a successful passkey sign-in occurs.
- **Rent coverage month label off by one for end-of-month due dates** — The coverage month label was computed by building a datetime for the due date and adding 1 day, which caused due dates on the last day of the month (e.g., Jan 31) to roll into the next month (Feb). Coverage month is now derived directly from `payment.coverage_month` and `payment.coverage_year`, which already hold the correct billing period.
- **Docs: GitHub-style alert rendering** — `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!WARNING]`, and `> [!CAUTION]` callouts in markdown files now render as styled alert boxes instead of displaying the raw `[!TYPE]` text inside a plain blockquote. A `preprocess_github_alerts()` pre-processor was added to `app/routes/docs.py` that converts alert blockquotes in the markdown source before the library renders them, circumventing a Python `markdown` library limitation where adjacent blockquotes are merged into one element. Each alert body is rendered through a dedicated markdown pass so inline and block markup (bold, code, links, lists) inside the alert body is fully processed. Five alert types are supported with on-brand colours and Material Symbols icons: Note (blue/info), Tip (teal/lightbulb), Important (purple/priority_high), Warning (amber/warning), Caution (red/dangerous).
- **Docs: Unordered list display** — Lists were sometimes rendering without bullets due to missing `list-style-type` declarations and Python markdown's "loose list" behaviour (wrapping each item's content in `<p>` tags, which some browser/CSS combinations display as block paragraphs). Added explicit `list-style-type: disc/decimal`, `display: list-item`, and compact `<p>`-inside-`<li>` margin rules to the documentation stylesheet.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-04

### Security
- **Class Deletion Audit** — Comprehensive audit of all four class/period deletion paths, identifying inconsistent semantics, a P1 BalanceCache orphaning bug, sysadmin use of the deprecated `Student.block` field, and missing data-loss warnings in sysadmin confirmation dialogs. See `docs/SECURITY/AUDITS/SEC-AUD-011_Class_Deletion_Audit.md`.
- **P1 fix: BalanceCache orphaning** — `_hard_delete_join_code_scope` now deletes `balance_cache` rows for the deleted `join_code`, preventing stale balance reads after class deletion.
- **P2 fix: Sysadmin period deletion scope** — `delete_period` now resolves the period name to its `join_code(s)` via `TeacherBlock` before finding enrolled students, replacing the deprecated `Student.block` field lookup.
- **P2 fix: Sysadmin confirmation UX** — Period and teacher account deletion dialogs now accurately describe what is preserved versus removed and note the action cannot be undone.
- **P3 fix: Orphaned settings cleanup** — `_hard_delete_join_code_scope` now deletes `PayrollSettings` and `RentSettings` for block names that have no remaining `TeacherBlock` entries after a join-code deletion.

### Changed
- **Post-claim PII minimisation** — `dob_sum` and `last_name_hash_by_part` are now deleted from both the `TeacherBlock` roster seat and the `Student` record immediately after a student completes account setup. These fields are only needed during the one-time claim verification; retaining them afterwards served no purpose and increased the sensitive-data footprint.
  - `TeacherBlock.dob_sum` and `TeacherBlock.last_name_hash_by_part` are nulled when `is_claimed` is set to `True` (all claim paths: initial claim, add-class, recovery).
  - `Student.dob_sum` and `Student.last_name_hash_by_part` are nulled in `setup_pin_passphrase` once credentials are established; `has_completed_profile_migration` is set to `True` at the same time to suppress the legacy migration prompt.
  - `TeacherBlock.dob_sum` and `TeacherBlock.last_name_hash_by_part` database columns made nullable via migration `a1b2c3d4e5f6`.
- **Simplified student account recovery** — The recovery flow no longer asks students to re-enter their name and date of birth. The new two-step flow is: enter join code + reset code → set up new username + credentials. First name and last initial are preserved from the teacher-managed roster and are not editable by the student.
  - `recovery.account_lookup` now clears credentials (username, PIN, passphrase) directly on successful code verification and redirects to `student.create_username`.
  - `recovery.verify_identity` is retired; the route now redirects to `recovery.account_lookup` so bookmarked URLs remain functional.
- **`add_class` credential verification scoped to target class** — When a student adds a new class, credentials (first initial, last name, DOB) are now verified exclusively against the target class's own unclaimed roster seat hashes. The previous pre-check against the student's stored `dob_sum` (which is null post-claim) has been removed. Each join_code is an independent verification universe; claiming one class does not expose or depend on hashes from another.
- **`claim_account` duplicate detection** — Finding an existing student during initial claim now uses `first_half_hash` lookup instead of `dob_sum` filter, which remains correct after post-claim PII cleanup.
- **Documentation system consolidation** — Migrated remaining loose markdown files into the canonical documentation taxonomy under `docs/LOGS/AUDITS`, updated references to the new locations, and refreshed the canonical docs index.

### Added
- **Collective Goal Expiration** — Teachers can now set an optional expiration date on collective goal store items.
  - If the goal is met before the deadline, the item unlocks normally (existing behavior unchanged).
  - If the deadline passes without the goal being reached, all pending purchases are automatically refunded, the item is deactivated, and a `voided` status is recorded for each affected `StudentItem`.
  - Expiration is processed lazily: triggered on admin store page load, student shop load, and at purchase time — no background scheduler required.
  - Teacher deactivating an active collective item also triggers automatic refund for all pending purchasers.
  - A reactivated collective goal always starts progress at zero because voided `StudentItem` records are excluded from the progress count.
  - New `collective_goal_expires_at` column on `StoreItem` with Alembic migration `e3f4g5h6i7j8`.
  - New `app/utils/store.py` module with `refund_pending_collective_purchases()` and `process_expired_collective_goals()` helpers.
  - 16 new tests in `tests/test_collective_goal_expiration.py` covering happy paths, edge cases, API blocking, and multi-tenancy scoping.
- **Admin Transaction Backfill** — One-time remediation page (`/admin/backfill-transactions`) that lets teachers fix student balances when past transactions lack a class-period `join_code`. Detected automatically on dashboard load; teachers select the correct period for each affected student and the system links all orphaned transactions to the right class context.
- **Interactive Project Timeline** — New `/docs/timeline` page showcasing the full development history of Classroom Token Hub
  - Visual vertical timeline organized into four eras: Genesis, Crisis Resolution, Feature Expansion, and Refinement
  - Filter bar: All / Features / Fixes & Crises / Security / Architecture / Philosophy
  - Expandable version cards with details on every release from v1.0.0 through current unreleased
  - Design Philosophy section with all ten anti-goals and core educational principles
  - Scroll-triggered entry animations with intersection observer
  - Linked from the Help & Support Center (`/docs/`) index and Quick Links section
  - Added `docs/LOGS/AUDITS/LOG-ARC-039_Project_Timeline.md` as the source timeline document

### Changed
- **System Admin interface redesigned** - Complete redesign matching teacher/student interface patterns
  - **Mobile-friendly layout** - Fixed sidebar with hamburger toggle on mobile, mobile bottom navigation bar with quick access to Dashboard, Teachers, Support, Logs, and Announcements
  - **Dashboard revamped** - Stat cards (Total Teachers, Total Students, Active Invites, Open Tickets), 6 quick-action buttons, recent teacher registrations and errors panels, system admins table
  - **Teacher Management consolidated** - Unified page combining invite code generation/voiding (with copy-to-clipboard and void button), teacher accounts with class badges, student counts, last login, status, and per-period/account deletion actions; pending deletion requests displayed in a dedicated table
  - **Logs consolidated** - New combined `/sysadmin/combined-logs` page with tabbed Error Logs and Network Activity views; raw system log viewer removed (Grafana available instead)
  - **Support Tickets unified** - New combined `/sysadmin/support` page showing both User Reports (teachers + students) and Escalated Issues in tabs; bug bounty reward workflow preserved; detail views link back to the unified page
- **Template Design System Unification** - Standardized template styling across teacher, student, and sysadmin views
  - Replaced legacy Bootstrap icon usage (`bi-*`) with Material Symbols in templates and JS-rendered button states
  - Removed legacy opacity utility patterns (`bg-opacity-*`) in favor of semantic subtle backgrounds (`bg-*-subtle`)
  - Replaced hardcoded inline color literals in template style contexts with token/semantic values
  - Normalized standalone and shell templates to use consistent token-driven theming behavior

### Added
- **`void_invite_code` route** (`/sysadmin/manage-teachers/void/<id>`) - Allows sysadmin to void unused invite codes directly from the Teacher Management page
- **`combined_logs` route** (`/sysadmin/combined-logs`) - New consolidated log viewer combining error logs and network activity
- **`support_tickets` route** (`/sysadmin/support`) - New consolidated support ticket view combining user reports and escalated issues
- **`open_tickets` stat** on dashboard - Shows sum of new user reports + pending/in-review escalated issues

### Performance
- **Read-Path Audit & Optimization** - Conducted comprehensive audit of student list rendering and admin dashboard performance
  - **Removed Write-on-Read Side Effects**: Refactored `Student.checking_balance`, `Student.savings_balance`, and `Student.total_earnings` properties to be read-only calculations. Moved legacy automated settlement logic (which triggered database writes during read operations) to explicit mutation endpoints (`/transfer`, `/pay-rent`). This eliminates race conditions and significantly improves read performance.
  - **Optimized Admin Dashboard internals**: Refactored daily limit enforcement (`auto_tapout`) to use batch processing instead of per-student iteration and moved dashboard balance calculations to batched, scoped queries. Stage 2 audit kept dashboard query totals unchanged at 402 (explicit dashboard query-count reduction remains out of scope for this stage).
  - **Optimized Student Roster**: Eliminated N+1 query patterns in the student management table by batch-fetching balances and rent privileges. Query count reduced from ~1225 to ~10 for a class of 60 students.
  - **Scoped Balance Calculations**: Fixed a critical multi-tenancy flaw where student balances were aggregated across all classes instead of being scoped to the current teacher's context. Dashboard and roster now correctly reflect class-specific financial state.

### Fixed
- **Student rent/shop regression follow-up** - Addressed review-driven cleanup after the rent/store hotfix
  - Added shared helper logic for determining whether a student's current rent coverage period is paid, and reused it across student rent/shop and API purchase flows to reduce duplicated validation code
  - Kept incremental rent payment form available when incremental mode is enabled (even when full remaining balance exceeds checking), so partial payments are not blocked in the UI
  - Corrected mixed rent-link behavior in student shop so privilege-only rent items are deactivated while per-use rent perks remain purchasable at `$0`
  - Made the mixed rent-link regression test time-independent by using a relative due date instead of a fixed calendar date
- **Student store block scoping** - Student shop and purchase APIs now enforce block visibility while preserving the existing "no block mapping = visible to all blocks" semantics for unscoped legacy items
- **Student markdown toolbar icons restored** - Reintroduced Font Awesome in the student layout so markdown editor toolbar icons render correctly on student issue forms
- **Student payroll rate lookup** - Student payroll page and status projections now pass teacher context into pay-rate resolution so block-specific teacher rates display correctly instead of defaulting
- **P0: Duplicate auto-tap-out events causing payroll overpayment** - Added idempotency check to prevent race conditions when multiple sources (student browser polling, scheduled job, admin dashboard) call auto-tap-out logic simultaneously. Previously, duplicate "Daily limit reached" tap-out events would be created, causing payroll to count the same session multiple times and resulting in massive overpayment. Now checks if a daily limit tap-out already exists before creating a new one. Includes cleanup script (`cleanup_duplicate_tapouts.py`) to fix existing duplicate records. See `docs/LOGS/AUDITS/LOG-ARC-038_Duplicate_Tapout_Bug_Report.md` for full details.
- **Void redemption creating transactions without join_code** - Fixed `/api/reject-redemption` endpoint creating refund transactions with `join_code=NULL` when voiding redemptions for legacy StudentItem records. Added fallback logic to resolve join_code from TeacherBlock or current session when StudentItem.join_code is NULL, preventing balance fix warnings for teachers. This resolves the "Fix Student Balances" alert appearing after voiding old redemptions.
- **Void transaction CSRF 400 error** - Fixed student detail page void transaction button failing with 400 error. Added missing X-CSRFToken header to fetch request in `voidTransaction()` JavaScript function. Teachers can now successfully void transactions from student detail pages.
- **P0: Rent payment applied to wrong period with bill preview enabled** - Fixed critical bug where students with unpaid overdue rent were allowed to pre-pay for future periods instead of paying overdue amounts first. When bill preview was enabled with a long preview period (e.g., 30 days), the system incorrectly classified overdue students as being in "preview period" for next month's rent. This caused payments to be recorded for the wrong coverage period (next month instead of current/overdue month), preventing students from receiving rent benefits even after paying. Now verifies current coverage period is fully paid before allowing preview period payments. Students must pay oldest overdue period first, and benefits are granted immediately when current period is paid. Also fixed rent page to display correct period being paid for with OVERDUE badge when applicable.
- **Rent transaction month label now matches the coverage period being paid** - Fixed rent payment transaction descriptions to use the selected coverage due date (e.g., January 2026 for overdue January rent paid on February 17) instead of the wall-clock payment month. This keeps late-fee transactions aligned with the actual rent period and avoids showing overdue January payments as February charges.
- **Recovery and Claim Page Styling Not Applying** - Fixed account claim/recovery pages that referenced design tokens but did not load `tokens.css`
  - Added missing `tokens.css` includes in standalone recovery/claim templates
  - Corrected student recovery layout shell class from `student-theme` to `student-shell`
  - Restored valid template syntax in `student_detail.html` that affected recovery-related page rendering/tests
- **Documentation site link integrity** - Corrected stale docs navigation paths, breadcrumb dead links, and release-note route resolution so technical docs render from the current taxonomy with validated internal/external links.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Rent Item Types (Privilege / Per-Use / Hall Pass)** - Extended itemized rent with three distinct item types
  - **Privilege**: Shows as a badge on the roster when rent is paid; optionally listed in store for individual purchase
  - **Per-Use**: Grants free store redemptions when rent is paid (single-use by default, or limited uses when set); always listed in store with "Rent Perk" badge; cannot be deleted from store (only via rent settings)
  - **Hall Pass**: Tops off student hall passes when rent is paid using source-tracking model (rent-granted vs purchased passes tracked separately via `StudentBlock.rent_hall_passes`)
  - **Mid-period edit guardrail**: Once any student has paid rent for the current period, item type, use limits, and hall pass counts are locked; only cosmetic changes (name, description, price) are allowed
  - **Store integration**: Per-use items marked `is_rent_linked` on `StoreItem`, preventing accidental deletion; admin store shows "Rent Perk" badge with disabled delete buttons for linked items
  - **Multi-use item tracking**: Added `uses_remaining` to `StudentItem` for per-use rent items with limited uses
  - **Free uses from rent**: When rent is fully paid, per-use items grant a free `StudentItem` with `uses_remaining` set (default 1); students can redeem these at no cost via the store
  - **Free purchase flow**: Store purchase route checks for active rent-granted uses before charging; shows "Free use (rent perk)" message
  - **Student shop indicators**: Rent-linked items show free uses remaining badge; "Included in your rent!" only shown for privilege-type items
  - **Models**: Added `rent_item_type`, `use_limit`, `hall_pass_count` to `RentItem`; `is_rent_linked` to `StoreItem`; `rent_hall_passes` to `StudentBlock`; `uses_remaining` to `StudentItem`
  - **Migrations**: `c2d9cf951ddc`, `9b0e06f05fcf`, `2765a36d76ff` (all idempotent)
- **Pre-paid Rent Coverage Period Tracking** - Rent payments now explicitly track which period they cover
  - Added `coverage_month` and `coverage_year` columns to `RentPayment` model
  - Paying rent on the due date (e.g., 1/28) now covers the student from 1/29 to the next due date (2/28)
  - All rent privilege checks, purchase blocking, dashboard status, and shop indicators use coverage-based lookups
  - Itemized rent item purchases (`per_period` duration) follow the same coverage period
  - **Migration**: `a1b2c3d4e5f6` adds columns with backfill from existing `period_month`/`period_year`

### Fixed
- **Privilege Badges Showing Non-Privilege Rent Items** - Fixed roster badge display to only show privilege-type rent items, not per-use or hall pass items
  - **Issue**: `_build_rent_privileges_by_block()` and `_get_rent_privileges_for_student()` filtered by `purchase_duration='per_period'` but not `rent_item_type='privilege'`, causing per-use and hall pass items to incorrectly appear as roster badges
  - **Solution**: Added `rent_item_type='privilege'` filter to both functions and the student shop "Included in your rent!" indicator
- **Insurance Class Selector Not Filtering Data** - Fixed multi-tenancy scoping issue where insurance management page showed all classes' data regardless of selected class
  - **Issue**: The "Viewing Insurance For" dropdown on the Insurance Management page did not filter policies, enrollments, or claims. Teachers with multiple class periods saw all insurance data aggregated together instead of scoped to the selected period.
  - **Root Cause**:
    - `InsurancePolicy` queries filtered only by `teacher_id`, not by `InsurancePolicyBlock.block`
    - `StudentInsurance` enrollments were not filtered by `join_code`
    - `InsuranceClaim` queries did not include `join_code` filtering
  - **Solution**:
    - Added `InsurancePolicyBlock` join to filter policies by selected block (or show policies available to all blocks)
    - Added `join_code` lookup from `TeacherBlock` for the selected period
    - Added `join_code` filter to all `StudentInsurance` and `InsuranceClaim` queries
  - **Impact**: Teachers now see only the insurance policies, enrollments, and claims for the currently selected class period
- **Store Purchase Blocked After Rent Paid Across Month Boundary** - Fixed rent-check logic using wrong month/year when verifying rent payments
  - **Issue**: `purchase_item()` used `now.month`/`now.year` instead of `current_due.month`/`current_due.year` when querying `RentPayment`. When a rent due date fell in January but the purchase check ran in February (past the grace period), the query looked for February payments and found none, incorrectly blocking the student.
  - **Solution**: All rent lookups now use `coverage_month`/`coverage_year` derived from the due date, not the wall-clock time
- **Issue Ticket Filing Fails With "An error occurred"** - Fixed Decimal serialization error in issue context snapshots
  - **Issue**: `create_context_snapshot()` stored raw `Decimal` objects (balances, transaction amounts) in a dict destined for a `db.JSON` column. Python's `json` module cannot serialize `Decimal`, causing a `TypeError` caught by the generic exception handler.
  - **Solution**: Convert all `Decimal` values to `float` before storing in the context snapshot
- **Duplicate Store Items When Applying Rent to All Periods** - Fixed `_sync_rent_items_to_store` creating duplicate store items
  - **Issue**: When a teacher applied rent settings to multiple blocks, each block created its own store item copy instead of sharing one item with block visibility
  - **Solution**: Look up existing store items by `teacher_id` + `name` before creating new ones; use `StoreItemBlock` to add block visibility without replacing existing associations

### Changed
- **Redundant Check Removal** - Simplified `_add_period` utility function in `app/routes/api.py` by removing a redundant `isinstance` check.
- **Documentation Update Plan Retired** - Removed `docs/development/DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_PLAN.md` after v1.7 documentation updates were completed and tracked.

### Security
- **Hardened Grafana Proxy XSS Protection** - Improved content-type filtering to prevent XSS attacks (#897)
  - **Issue**: Original implementation had case-sensitivity issues, missed dangerous MIME types (SVG), and could be bypassed
  - **Solution**:
    - Made Content-Type check case-insensitive per RFC 2045
    - Added `image/svg+xml`, `text/xsl`, and `application/xslt+xml` to blocked MIME types
    - Properly handles Content-Type parameters (e.g., "text/html; charset=utf-8")
  - Prevents reflected XSS attacks via Grafana proxy endpoint
- **Fixed Function Redefinition in Student Routes** - Removed duplicate `_is_safe_url` function definition (#897)
  - **Issue**: Two identical function definitions in `add_class()` route, causing code clarity issues
  - **Solution**: Removed redundant first definition, kept wrapper around shared `is_safe_url` helper
  - Improves code maintainability and prevents potential bugs from function shadowing

## [1.7.1] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Decimal.InvalidOperation in Student Dashboard Earnings/Spending Calculations** - Fixed crash when calculating weekly/monthly analytics with NULL transaction amounts
  - **Issue**: Dashboard earnings and spending calculations compared `tx.amount > Decimal('0')` without checking for NULL
  - **Impact**: Student dashboard returned 500 error with `decimal.InvalidOperation: [<class 'decimal.InvalidOperation'>]` when corrupted transactions exist
  - **Affected Code**: Lines 1261-1283 in `app/routes/student.py` (earnings_this_week, earnings_this_month, spending_this_week, spending_this_month)
  - **Additional Fix**: Line 1697 in savings interest calculation also needed NULL check
  - **Solution**: Added null check (`tx.amount is not None`) before all Decimal comparisons in dashboard calculations
  - Completes the NULL handling fix from PR #885 which fixed the Student model properties
- **Duplicate Student Claim Handling** - Added IntegrityError handling for duplicate student account claims
  - **Issue**: Edge cases in deduplication logic could cause IntegrityError when claiming student accounts with duplicate `first_half_hash` values
  - **Solution**: Wrapped `db.session.flush()` in try-except block to catch IntegrityError and link to existing student accounts gracefully
  - Prevents crashes and provides better user experience when duplicate claims occur
- **NameError in Payroll Function** - Fixed import error for `calculate_payroll_breakdown` in admin routes
  - **Issue**: Admin payroll routes referenced `calculate_payroll_breakdown` without proper import
  - **Solution**: Added explicit import of `calculate_payroll_breakdown` from `app.payroll` module
- **Decimal.InvalidOperation in recent_deposits** - Fixed crash when accessing student dashboard with NULL transaction amounts
  - **Issue**: `Student.recent_deposits` property compared `tx.amount <= Decimal('0')` without checking for NULL
  - **Impact**: Student dashboard returned 500 error with `decimal.InvalidOperation: [<class 'decimal.InvalidOperation'>]`
  - **Solution**: Added null check (`tx.amount is None`) before comparison in both `recent_deposits` and `total_earnings` properties
  - Prevents crashes when database has corrupted transaction data with NULL amounts
- **CRITICAL: Float/Decimal Type Error in Savings Interest Calculation** - Fixed `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'float' and 'decimal.Decimal'` in `apply_savings_interest()` function
  - **Issue**: The `student.savings_balance` property returns a `float`, but interest calculations were using `Decimal` arithmetic. When the float balance was multiplied by a Decimal rate expression, Python raised a TypeError.
  - **Impact**: Student dashboard returned 500 errors when compound interest was enabled for the class
  - **Root Cause**: The Decimal refactoring (PR #882) updated the interest calculation logic to use Decimal, but the `savings_balance` property still returns float for backward compatibility with other parts of the codebase
  - **Solution**: Wrap `student.savings_balance` with `_quantize_currency()` to convert it to Decimal before performing Decimal arithmetic
  - **Location**: `app/routes/student.py` in `apply_savings_interest()` function, line 1621
- **Decimal JSON Serialization Error** - Fixed `TypeError: Object of type Decimal is not JSON serializable` in student dashboard and API endpoints
  - **Issue**: After Decimal refactoring, Decimal values in templates and JSON responses were not converted to serializable types
  - **Impact**: Student dashboard and `/api/student-status` endpoint returned 500 errors
  - **Solution**: Convert all Decimal values to float before passing to templates or JSON serialization:
    - `app/routes/student.py`: Dashboard variables (checking_balance, savings_balance, forecast_interest, earnings, spending, projected_pay_per_block)
    - `app/routes/student.py`: Student dashboard `period_states_json`
    - `app/routes/api.py`: `/student/start-work` and `/student/stop-work` endpoints (projected_pay)
    - `app/routes/api.py`: `/student/status` endpoint (period_states)
  - Maintains Decimal precision for calculations, converts only at template/serialization boundary
- **CRITICAL: Decimal Precision in All Financial Calculations** - Refactored all financial logic to use Python's `Decimal` type throughout, not just for database storage
  - **Issue**: PR #880 was a hotfix that converted `Decimal` to `float` to resolve TypeErrors, but introduced floating-point precision errors
  - **Impact**: Small residual balances accumulate over time, incorrect interest calculations, potential overdraft fee issues
  - **Solution**: Systematic refactoring of all financial calculations to use Decimal arithmetic
  - **Changes**:
    - Updated `Student.get_checking_balance()` and `Student.get_savings_balance()` to return Decimal instead of float
    - Updated `calculate_scoped_balances()` to return Decimal tuples
    - Refactored all interest calculations in `student.py` to use Decimal arithmetic with proper exponentiation
    - Updated `apply_savings_interest()` to use Decimal throughout for compound and simple interest
    - Refactored transfer route to convert form inputs to Decimal before validation
    - Updated rent payment processing to use Decimal for payment amounts
    - Updated `payroll.py` `get_pay_rate_for_block()` to return Decimal per-second rate
    - Refactored all `admin.py` financial form handling (rent, payroll, store items, rewards, fines) to use `_quantize_currency()`
    - Updated `api.py` demo session balance inputs to use Decimal
    - Updated `system_admin.py` reward amounts to use Decimal
    - Refactored `utils/economy_balance.py` CWI calculations and balance validators to use Decimal
    - Updated `_normalize_to_weekly()` helper to work with Decimal inputs/outputs
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Decimal objects convert to float only for JSON serialization and template rendering
  - **Testing**: All existing decimal precision tests pass; financial calculations now mathematically exact
- **Decimal.InvalidOperation in get_total_earnings** - Fixed crash when calculating student earnings with NULL transaction amounts
  - Added null check (`tx.amount is not None`) before comparison in `get_total_earnings()` method
  - Prevents `decimal.InvalidOperation` error on `/admin/students` page when database has corrupted transaction data
  - Handles edge case where historical data migrations or database inconsistencies result in NULL amounts
  - Fix applied to all three code paths (join_code, teacher_id, and no parameters)
- **CRITICAL: Floating-Point Rounding Errors in Financial Calculations** - Converted all financial amounts from Float to Decimal for exact precision
  - **Bug 1**: Transfers that zeroed out checking accounts incorrectly triggered $35 overdraft fees due to -0.00 balance representation
  - **Bug 2**: Partial rent payments left unpayable tiny balances (e.g., $0.0000001) due to float precision errors
  - **Fix**: Changed `Transaction.amount` from `Float` to `Numeric(12, 2)` in database for exact decimal representation
  - **Fix**: Updated all financial models (RentSettings, BankingSettings, PayrollSettings, StoreItem, InsurancePolicy, etc.) to use Numeric
  - **Fix**: Updated balance calculation methods to use Python's `Decimal` type instead of `float`
  - **Fix**: Added near-zero balance normalization (|balance| < $0.01 → $0.00) to prevent false overdraft fees
  - **Migration**: Created migration to convert all Float columns to Numeric(12, 2) without data loss
  - **Testing**: Added comprehensive test suite for edge cases (zero transfers, partial payments, near-zero balances)
- **Student Creation Without Deprecated teacher_id** - Removed deprecated `teacher_id` assignment when creating new students to prevent `TypeError: 'teacher_id' is an invalid keyword argument for Student`.
- **Scheduled Auto Tap-Out Transactions** - Avoided committing inside the scheduled auto tap-out loop to prevent closed-transaction errors during background checks.
- **Student Claim DOB Field** - Aligned the claim-account form field name with the templates to prevent 500 errors on /student/claim-account.
- **Student Transfer Banking Settings Import** - Removed a local import shadowing `BankingSettings` to prevent UnboundLocalError on /student/transfer.
- **Rent Calculation Accuracy** - Improved rent amount calculations for monthly display (#839)
  - Fixed daily rent calculation to use actual days in month (via `monthrange`) instead of approximating 30 days
  - Added support for 'custom' frequency type in rent calculation logic
  - Fixed timezone inconsistency by using timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` consistently
  - Added null checks for `grace_period_days` and `due_day_of_month` fields to prevent TypeError
  - Refactored duplicated late payment check logic into single code path
  - Optimized payments query using subquery instead of list comprehension for better performance
- **Rent Statistics Display** - Fixed incorrect student counts in rent overview cards (#839)
  - "Paid This Month" now correctly shows count of students who paid (not payment count)
  - "Unpaid This Month" now correctly shows count of students with outstanding balances
  - Both statistics use accurate `unpaid_students` calculation instead of payment count
- **Rent Period Display** - Fixed misleading "Period" column in unpaid students list (#839)
  - Now shows billing period (e.g., "January 2026") instead of class block/period
- **Hall Pass Queue Scoping** - Removed deprecated `students.teacher_id` filtering to prevent hall pass queue errors.

### Changed
- **Rent Calculation Helper** - Extracted rent amount calculation into reusable helper function (#839)
  - Created `_calculate_base_rent_amount()` helper to avoid code duplication
  - Used in both payroll warning calculation and unpaid students calculation
  - Follows DRY principle for better maintainability
- **CSP Headers for Public Hall Pass Pages** - Modified Content Security Policy to allow embedding for read-only hall pass display pages
  - `/hall-pass/verification` and `/hall-pass/queue` can now be embedded in external sites (e.g., Schoology, Canvas)
  - These pages are public, read-only displays with no state-changing actions
  - `/hall-pass/terminal` remains protected (not embeddable) as it performs state-changing check-in/check-out actions
  - Removed `X-Frame-Options` header for embeddable pages and added `frame-ancestors *` to CSP
  - All other pages remain protected with `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` and `frame-ancestors 'self'`

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-09

- **Analytics Events Value Display** - Show zero-value economy changes in the analytics events timeline by checking for `None` instead of falsy values.
- **EasyMDE Form Submission** - Fixed issue where forms with EasyMDE markdown editors could not be submitted due to hidden required fields
  - EasyMDE markdown editor hides the underlying textarea, causing browser validation to fail on required fields
  - Removed HTML `required` attribute from hidden textareas after editor initialization
  - Server-side validation via `DataRequired()` still enforces required fields
  - Applied fix to insurance claim form (`student_file_claim.html`) and issue submission form (`student_submit_issue.html`)
  - Resolves console error: "An invalid form control with name='[field]' is not focusable"

### Added

- **Enhanced Purchase Restrictions** - "Prevent Purchase When Late" toggle now has dynamic behavior based on itemization
  - When rent itemization is disabled: blocks ALL store purchases when student is late on rent (original behavior)
  - When rent itemization is enabled: students late on rent can ONLY purchase items covered by rent (at à la carte prices), all other store items blocked
  - Creates strong incentive structure: pay rent to get everything, or buy individual rent items at higher prices while missing out on other store items
  - UI dynamically updates toggle label and description based on itemization status
  - JavaScript updates label when items are added/removed dynamically
  - Implemented in `/api/purchase-item` endpoint with proper rent late detection and item validation
- **Purchase Duration Options for Rent Items** - Teachers can now choose how long individually-purchased rent items last
  - New `purchase_duration` field on RentItem model: 'per_use' or 'per_period'
  - **Per Use**: Student must buy each time they want to use it (unlimited purchases allowed)
  - **Per Rent Period**: Student buys once and can use until next rent is due (limit 1, expires when rent comes due)
  - Radio button selector in rent itemization UI with clear explanations
  - Store items automatically configured with appropriate purchase limits based on duration type
  - Purchase API calculates expiration dates for "per_period" items based on rent frequency settings
  - Automated expiration when next rent payment is due

  - Fixed `/api/hall-pass/settings` endpoint to scope settings by `teacher_id` from session
  - Fixed hall pass creation in `/tap` endpoint to retrieve `teacher_id` from `join_code` via `TeacherBlock` lookup
  - All `HallPassSettings` queries now properly scoped by `teacher_id` and `block`
- **Content Security Policy** - Restored `'unsafe-eval'` directive to `script-src` CSP policy as it is required by passwordless.dev library's minified build (uses `new Function()` internally)
- **Passkey Authentication** - Fixed environment variables not loading by specifying explicit path to `.env` file in `load_dotenv()` call - ensures environment is loaded regardless of gunicorn working directory
- **Passkey Authentication** - Fixed token destructuring in `signinWithDiscoverable()` to properly handle error responses from passwordless.dev SDK
- **Deployment** - Added verification steps to confirm environment variables are properly written to `.env` and loaded by systemd service

  - New route `/help-support/tap-event/<id>/report` for reporting attendance record issues
  - Report buttons added to all tap event tables in Work & Pay > Attendance Record tab
  - Uses same issue resolution workflow as transaction reporting
  - Students can report up to 20 most recent tap events per block
- **Issue Resolution & Escalation System** - Structured, teacher-mediated issue handling system
  - **Student Features**:
    - New Help & Support interface with 3 tabs: Knowledge Base, Report an Issue, My Issues
    - Submit general issues (clock-in problems, features not working, balance incorrect, etc.)
    - Report transaction-specific issues directly from transaction history
    - Help icons next to each transaction in Recent Activity for quick issue reporting
    - Character-limited submissions (1000 chars) to encourage concise reporting

    - Data minimization for sysadmin review
    - Status badges only (non-communicative design)
  - Routes:
    - Student: `/student/help-support`, `/student/help-support/submit-issue`, `/student/help-support/transaction/<id>/report`

### Fixed
- **Store Item Creation** - Fixed critical bug where tier, collective_goal_type, collective_goal_target, and redemption_prompt fields were not being saved when creating new store items
  - Added `tier` field assignment to store creation route (app/routes/admin.py:3047)
  - Added `collective_goal_type` and `collective_goal_target` field assignments for collective goal items (app/routes/admin.py:3063-3064)
  - Added `redemption_prompt` field assignment for delayed-use items (app/routes/admin.py:3066)
  - These fields were already present in the form (forms.py) and model (models.py), but were not being passed to the StoreItem constructor
  - Edit functionality uses `populate_obj` rather than manually assigning these fields, so this bug specifically affected the creation route
- **Transaction Issue Reporting** - Added report buttons to all transaction tables in Banking/Finances page (Checking and Savings tabs), allowing students to report issues on any visible transaction (up to 50 most recent), not just the 5 shown on dashboard
- **Issue Resolution Display** - Fixed `developer_resolved` status showing as "Escalated" instead of "Resolved by Developer" in teacher view
- **Issue Context Snapshot** - Fixed incorrect balance calculation in context_snapshot by using Student model's `get_checking_balance()` and `get_savings_balance()` methods instead of non-existent `get_balances()` function
- **Passkey Authentication** - Fixed missing username parameter in passkey authentication start request causing 500 error
- **Passkey Registration** - Fixed credential ID extraction from passwordless.dev SDK response by using correct destructuring pattern `{ token, error }`
- **Content Security Policy** - Added `https://static.cloudflareinsights.com` to `connect-src` directive to allow Cloudflare analytics
- **Content Security Policy** - Added `worker-src 'self' blob:` directive to allow Web Workers used by passwordless.dev library
- Fixed `time.tzset()` Windows compatibility issue in wsgi.py - now only calls tzset() on Unix-like systems
- Fixed admin signup crash when using SQLite - handles datetime fields stored as strings
- System Admin announcements form `ValueError` by adding a custom `coerce` for the `target_teacher` field

### Security
- Enhanced privacy protection in issue resolution system through opaque student references
- Teacher-controlled data disclosure to sysadmins (optional class name sharing)
- **Content Security Policy** - Removed unnecessary `'unsafe-eval'` directive from `script-src` to strengthen XSS protection (passwordless.dev library does not require dynamic code execution)

    - Corrected default state - items are created as active by default, not inactive
    - Removed non-existent image upload feature documentation
    - Removed non-existent daily purchase limit documentation
    - Updated terminology to match code (Immediate Use/Delayed Use instead of Virtual/Physical)
    - Added missing "Collective Goal" item type to documentation with full explanation
    - Corrected purchase limits documentation to reflect actual behavior (concurrent ownership, not daily limits)
    - Updated scenario examples to use correct field names and remove daily limits
    - Removed confusing "if available" language for collective goals (feature is fully available)
    - Removed misleading "Use images" tip from Tips for Success section (feature doesn't exist)
    - Fixed contradictory troubleshooting text about daily limits (clarified to use inventory and per-student limits)
  - **Payroll (docs/user-guides/features/payroll/running-payroll.md)**:
    - Removed non-existent automatic payroll feature documentation (entire section)
