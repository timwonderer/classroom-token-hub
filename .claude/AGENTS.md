# Agent Handoff Notes

These notes orient future agents working on this repository—especially ongoing multi-tenancy hardening—so changes stay consistent and low-disruption.

## Quickstart

- **Branch:** `main` — all work merges here (see `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for the retired branch names).
- **Tests:** run `pytest -q` before committing; add focused tests for tenancy helpers when changing scoping logic.
- **App entry:** `wsgi.py`; Flask app factory in `app/__init__.py`.
- **Access gate:** Cloudflare Access manages restricted work windows. The app has no maintenance flag, page, or bypass (DOM-OPS-001).

## Database Migrations - CRITICAL FOR AGENTS

**⚠️ ALWAYS follow this workflow when creating migrations to prevent multiple heads errors:**

### Before Creating ANY Migration

1. **ALWAYS sync with the latest code first:**

   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   git merge origin/main
   ```

2. **Verify there is exactly ONE migration head:**

   ```bash
   flask db heads  # MUST show exactly 1 head
   ```

   If you see multiple heads, STOP and create a merge migration first:

   ```bash
   flask db merge heads -m "Merge migration heads"
   ```

3. **Check the current migration revision:**

   ```bash
   flask db current  # Note this revision ID
   ```

### Creating a Migration

1. **Make your model changes in `app/models.py`**

2. **Create the migration:**

   ```bash
   flask db migrate -m "Clear description of change"
   ```

3. **IMMEDIATELY verify the new migration:**
   - Open the generated file in `migrations/versions/`
   - Verify `down_revision` matches what `flask db current` showed
   - If it doesn't match, DELETE the migration and restart the workflow

4. **Test the migration:**

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade                # Apply it
   flask db downgrade <revision>   # Roll it back to the revision noted above
   flask db upgrade                # Apply it again
   ```

   Always pass an explicit revision to `flask db downgrade`: the bare form aborts with
   "Ambiguous walk" whenever the head is a merge point.

5. **Verify single head after creation:**

   ```bash
   flask db heads  # MUST still show exactly 1 head
   # OR use the quick check script:
   bash scripts/check-migration-heads.sh
   ```

### Quick Check Script

Before pushing ANY PR that includes migrations, run:

```bash
bash scripts/check-migration-heads.sh
```

This script will immediately tell you if there are multiple heads and provide fix instructions.

### Why This Matters

The repository has experienced recurring "multiple heads" errors during deployment because agents created migrations without syncing first. Each time this happens:

- Deployment blocks with errors
- Manual intervention required on production
- Risk of data inconsistencies

**The pre-push hook can't catch this when working through the web interface**, so agents MUST follow this workflow manually.

## Multi-Tenancy Snapshot

- **`class_id` (UUID) is the canonical source of truth for class isolation.** `join_code` is its public-facing alias — acceptable in user-facing flows but `class_id` is the authority for all domain-level queries and scoping.
- **`seat_id` anchors per-user activity within a class.** All financial, attendance, and obligation records are scoped by `seat_id` + `class_id`.
- **Identity is resolved once at the decorator boundary** via `resolve_canonical_context()`, producing an immutable `CanonicalContext(user_id, class_id, seat_id, actor_role)` or `BoundaryContext(user_id, actor_role)` stored in `g.canonical_context`. No handler reads extinct session keys (`admin_id`, `student_id`, `sysadmin_id`).
- **Teacher-to-class linkage** is `ClassEconomy.teacher_user_id` (the `classes` table). `ClassMembership` and the rest of the v1 identity layer no longer exist as models or tables.
- Scoped query helpers and bridge functions were removed from `app/auth.py`; all routes use canonical context.
- Cloudflare Access provides the external gate; app authentication and class capability checks still apply.

## High-Priority Follow-Ups

1. **Database hardening**
   - Consider enforcing NOT NULL `class_id` on `ledger_transaction` after backfill verification (the model and baseline still declare it nullable; `attendance_sessions.class_id` is already NOT NULL). `join_code` is an ingress alias and must not become a required scoping column.
   - Continue reducing legacy teacher-global assumptions in comments, fixtures, and helper signatures.
   - Review ON DELETE behavior for teacher `User` rows: `classes.teacher_user_id` is `ON DELETE CASCADE` while `seats.user_id` is `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, so teacher deletion must go through `app/services/teacher_destruction.py` (as the account-delete route and `teacher_lifecycle.destroy_stale_teacher` do), never a raw delete.
2. **Code audit**
   - Replace any residual seat lookup that is not class-scoped (e.g. `db.session.get(Seat, seat_id)` without checking `seat.class_id == class_id`) with `Seat.query.filter_by(id=seat_id, class_id=class_id)`.
   - Remove reliance on teacher-global scoping assumptions in any remaining legacy paths.
3. **Testing gaps**
   - Add shared-student coverage for payroll and attendance flows.
   - Add DB-level uniqueness test once constraint exists.
4. **Operational docs**
   - Write a runbook for the NOT NULL migration (pre/post checks, Cloudflare Access policy, backfill verification).

## PII/Privacy

- Keep PII minimal (current design uses non-PII identifiers; `IdentityProfile.first_name`, `last_name` and `notes` are `PIIEncryptedType` columns). Avoid adding new PII fields; prefer hashes or initials.

## Coding Conventions

- Prefer scoped helpers over ad-hoc filters for tenant access.
- Keep try/except blocks off import statements (per repo guidance).
- Update documentation (`../DEVELOPMENT.md`) when milestone status changes.

## Checklist Before PR

- Tests pass locally (`pytest -q`).
- Migrations reviewed for safety (lock impact, backfill steps, Access gate verification).
- UI changes include screenshots when visually meaningful (if browser tool available).
- Final summary cites files and commands per system instructions.

## PR Template

Use the repository's PR template, [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
GitHub pre-fills it; do not keep a second copy here, because a copy drifts from the original.
